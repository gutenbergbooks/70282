<span class="fs80">A LITTLE GIRL AND A BIG SEMINARY</span></h2>

<p class="no-indent">The nicest thing that ever happened to a little girl
eight years old was going to happen to Ella, and she
was so delighted that she could hardly sit still in the
big clumsy stage-coach that rolled and shook and
swung slowly away from the city. Uphill and downhill
it went, past ponds and meadows and brooks and
woods, and little new houses and big old homesteads
shaded by ancient elms or maples. Every roll of the
wheels brought the little passenger nearer to perfect
happiness.</p>

<p>Ella was going to live in a seminary, and surely
nothing could be more charming than that. She knew
all about seminaries, for she had visited one when she
was little—at least two years before. The girls had
petted her and given her candy; the principal had
presented her with a story-book. Best of all, she had
slept in an old-fashioned bed with a canopy, such a
bed as she had never seen anywhere else. What could
be more delightful! And now she was going to have
every day such pleasures as these, and no one knew
how much more marvelous ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>By and by the stage came to a scattered village
with a church or two, a schoolhouse, and a post-office.
After the mail had been left, the driver turned up a
long avenue with fields and a line of trees on either
hand. At the head of the avenue was a circle of tall
fir trees, and back of the circle was a large white building
with a wing at each end, a narrow piazza in front,
and tall fluted columns rising from its floor to the top
of the second story.</p>

<p>The driver called “Whoa!” A tall man came from
somewhere and shook hands with Ella’s mother and
with herself. Then he led the way upstairs to some
bare, almost unfurnished rooms. The mother was to
use the furniture from her old home, and it had not
yet arrived. After a little talk, they all went down
some dark and winding stairs to the dining-room, a
large, low, gloomy basement room with two long
tables. The end of one of them was “set,” and there
Ella and her mother and the tall man and two or
three other grown-ups ate supper.</p>

<p>A little later Ella and her mother went up to the
almost unfurnished rooms. Ella stood looking through
the open door down the lonely corridor. There were
no nice girls about; there was no canopy to the bed;
there were no story-books; there was no one to talk to
her. Everybody was grown up; there were no children.
There were no city lights, and the twilight
seemed to be shutting down faster than it ever did
before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, this doesn’t seem one bit, not one single bit,
like a seminary,” Ella cried.</p>

<p>The mother gathered her into her lap, and there the
little girl sobbed away her loneliness and disappointment,
and forgot it all in sleep. But the mother sat
beside the window, looking out into the darkness and
the past; for it was here that she and the father had
first met, in the old joyful student days; and now he
was gone, and she had come back, alone, to teach
students who were, as she had then been, at the happy
beginnings.</p>

<p>When the morning came, things were better, Ella
thought. The sun shone, and people began to gather.
The first arrivals were teachers and boy and girl students.
Then came students of earlier days, for the
seminary had been closed for some years and was now
to be reopened. There were people from the village
and the neighboring country, and a little later, when
the stage from the city drove up, there were a number
of dignified middle-aged men with long beards. These
men were to make speeches.</p>

<p>The mother was helping to welcome the guests, and
Ella wandered around alone. Before long she met a
boy a little smaller than herself. The two children
looked at each other.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” the boy asked.</p>

<p>“Ella. What’s yours?”</p>

<p>“John. My father’s the principal. What did you
have Christmas?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>“I had a doll and a bedstead for her and a book of
fairy stories,” the little girl replied. “What did you
have?”</p>

<p>“I had a sled and a rubber ball and some red
mittens.”</p>

<p>“I had a sled three Christmases ago, when I was
little,” said Ella. “Its name is Thomas Jefferson.
How old are you?”</p>

<p>“Six. But I’m going on seven,” he added quickly.</p>

<p>Ella was eight, going on nine, and she thought that
a boy who was only six was hardly more than a baby;
but he was better than nobody, so they spent most of
the day together.</p>

<p>It was a full day. The hundreds of people went
through the building; they ate a collation in the basement
dining-room; they renewed old friendships; and
at two o’clock they assembled in the little grove fronting
the main door to listen to the speeches.</p>

<p>And speeches there were, indeed; speeches on the
old days of the seminary and on the plans for its future;
and of course there was one on “The true theory
of education,” delivered by the man who knew least
about that subject. The lieutenant-governor of the
State sent a check for $100 for the library; the mayor
of the capital of the State sent one for $250. Ticknor
&amp; Fields, Little &amp; Brown, and Wendell Phillips all
presented books. Everybody was jubilant, and sunset
was only one hour distant when with three hearty
cheers for the seminary the people said good-bye to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
one another, and all but the teachers and the students
started for their homes.</p>

<p>Ella had not heard any of the speeches, but she had
found where early goldenrod and asters were growing;
she had learned that there was a beautiful lake whose
shore was a fine place to pick up pebbles and go in
wading; and she had discovered on the hastily arranged
shelves of the library some books that looked
interesting. She and John had only one grievance,
namely, that the watermelon had given out before it
came to their end of the table.</p>

<p>The next day classes were arranged and the regular
life of the seminary began. Ella was delighted to find
that she was to be called a “student” just as if she
had been grown up, and when a young man, already
lonesome for the little sister at home, asked her to
sit on his knee, she refused. It was of course quite
proper for a little girl to sit on the knee of an elderly
gentleman, as he seemed to her, but she did not
think that one “student” ought to sit on the knee of
another.</p>

<p>Ella’s mother had her own “theory of education.”
She thought that it was better for young children to
be out of doors than in a schoolroom, and that, when
they began to study, arithmetic and foreign languages
should come first. Ella had never been to school or
been taught at home. Somehow, she had learned to
read, no one knew exactly how, and she had read
every book that had come to hand if it looked at all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
interesting. One of these books was a small arithmetic.
It was quite the fashion in those days to bind
schoolbooks in paper of a bright salmon pink. Ella
liked the color, and the result was that she had picked
up some familiarity with addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division.</p>

<p>The professor of mathematics was a courteous,
scholarly young man just out of college. He said that
it would not trouble him in the least to have in one of
his classes a little girl in a short-sleeved, low-necked
blue muslin dress and “ankle-ties.” Apparently the
tall young men and young women students did not object
either; and the result was that for half an hour every
morning Ella made groups of straggling figures on
the blackboard, and with the kindly teaching of “my
professor,” as she proudly called the young instructor,
she learned to “invert the divisor and proceed as in
multiplication.” She learned also that a decimal point
has an uncanny power to reduce a comfortable number
of dollars to mere copper cents. She even learned
that “If a student purchased a Latin grammar for
$0.75, a Virgil for $3.75, a Greek lexicon for $4.75, a
Homer for $1.25, an English dictionary for $3.75, and
a Greek Testament for $0.75,” the whole cost of his
purchases would amount to $15. This was her favorite
among the “Practical Problems.” The teacher never
guessed the reason, but it was because she had read a
story about a carrier pigeon, and she was glad that
the student had a “homer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>Ella learned that “cwt.” meant <em>hundredweight</em>,
that “d” meant <em>penny</em>, and that a queer sign somewhat
like a written “L” meant <em>pound</em>. Why these
things should be, she had no idea; she supposed grown
people had just made them up. She could overlook
even such foolishness as this, but she did draw the
line at learning the multiplication table. It was in her
book, and she could turn to it at any time, so why
should she bother to learn it? The young professor
was always charitable to a new idea. He looked at the
child thoughtfully; maybe she was in the right. At
any rate, he only smiled when he saw how rapidly a
certain page in her arithmetic was wearing out. Before
it had quite disappeared, the multiplication
table, even with the eights and nines, was as firmly
fixed in the small pupil’s memory as if she had learned
it with tears and lamentations.</p>

<p>Ella spelled rather unusually well, perhaps because
in all her eight years she had seldom seen or heard a
word spelled incorrectly; but her handwriting was
about as bad as it could be, especially toward the end
of the page, where the “loops and tails” pointed as
many ways as if they had been an explosion of fireworks.
The tall principal, John’s father, taught penmanship,
and the little girl, with a copybook, a red-painted
penholder, and a viciously sharp “Gillott,
303,” took her place at one of the long, slanting tables
in the hall. It was much too high for her, but no one
was troubled about that in those days. If a table was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
too high, it was because the child was too short, and
that was all there was to it.</p>

<p>Day after day, Ella wrote in her copybook whole
pages of such thrilling statements as, “Be good and
you will be happy,” and, “Honesty is the best policy.”
Of the truth of the first she was by no means
convinced, for she remembered being—of necessity—very
well behaved, indeed, when she was not at
all happy. As to the second, she had no idea what
“policy” was. She asked the principal very shyly
what the sentence meant, and he said it meant that
little boys and girls must always tell the truth. Of
course no decent children ever told lies, thought
Ella, with a vague indignation. She pondered over
the reply, and at length made up her mind that the
writing-book must have been printed for children
that were ragged and dirty and said “ain’t got
none.” She had to finish the page, but every line
was worse written than the one before it. The principal
looked a little grave and asked if she was sure
that she had done her best. Ella hung her head and
said nothing; but maybe she had done her best—under
the circumstances.</p>

<p>The principal tried his utmost to teach her to write
the fine “Spencerian” hand that was then so admired;
but the wicked little “Gillott, 303,” continued to
stick in the paper and make sprays of ink all about—which
Ella rather admired as incipient pictures—and
the red-painted wooden penholder still aimed at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
whatever point of the compass happened to suit the
comfort of the little cramped fingers. “Where should
the pen point?” the principal would patiently ask;
and with equal patience the pupil would reply, “Over
the right shoulder.” It would turn into place obediently,
but long before the teacher had reached the
other end of the long table, it was again pointing out
the north window toward the lake or out the south
window to the hill and the rocks. And why not? Where
the thoughts were, surely the pen might point also.</p>

<p>Ella felt as if she was quite a busy little girl, for besides
her lessons in arithmetic and penmanship, there
was half an hour of French every day. It was good
strong old-fashioned French, too, learned by main
force from a grammar. She recited patiently, “Ah,
bay, say, day,” etc., as she was taught; but in her
heart of hearts she thought it utter foolishness to spoil
perfectly good English letters by giving them such
names. She learned that there were such things as
nasal sounds, objected to in English, but highly esteemed
in French; and she learned to translate into
the French language and pronounce—with an accent
that would have thrown the politest Frenchman into
a state of collapse—such interesting dialogue as,
“Have you the girl’s glove?” “No, sir, but I have
the cook’s hat”; and such bits of tragedy as, “My
brother’s tailor has broken my slate,” or—most
touching of all—“I liked the little girl, but she did
not like me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>French, even grammar French, carried Ella into a
new world. She concluded that to harmonize with its
caprices she ought to take a French name when, so to
speak, she entered France by way of Fasquelle’s
Grammar and the French recitation room. Somewhere
she had heard the word “elephantine,” and she
had read, in English, about Fantine and Cosette. She
concluded that this fine-sounding word—only she
would spell it <img style="width: 15%" src="images/20.jpg" alt="Elefantine"> and put on plenty of accents,
circumflexes, because she thought acutes and
graves had an unfinished look—would accord nicely
with her own name and would also be a compliment
to the French, especially if it was pronounced with a
good strong nasal sound in the middle of the word.</p>

<p>She was rather too shy to ask the French teacher to
call her <img style="width: 15%" src="images/20.jpg" alt="Elefantine">, but she wrote the name in her
Fasquelle, and had fine times saying it over to herself
when she was alone. One day the mother happened to
take up the book, and she showed Ella in the dictionary
what the word meant. All the poetry went out
of it then, for Ella always bowed to the authority of
the big dictionary; and she promptly rubbed out the
new name, accents and all.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br>
<span class="fs80">A LADY OF THE ENGLISH AND CLASSICAL GRADUATING COURSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">A second volume which Ella carried proudly under
her arm when she went to the French class was called
“Le Grandpère.” It was written expressly for the
use of schools—so said the title-page. It was
“Approuvé par le Conseil Royal de l’Instruction publique.”
If further proof was needed of its value,
the fact that it was “Carefully prepared for American
schools” was surely sufficient. How could anything
be better for a child to translate?</p>

<p>“Le Grandpère” began, with unpardonable guile,
quite like a story: “The old Captain Granville inhabited
a pretty village situated on the shore of the
Loire,” as Ella slowly translated it. But her suspicions
were soon aroused, for, looking ahead a few
lines, she found something about “charging himself
with overseeing their first education.” That did not
sound promising, though it was possible that the four
grandsons who were being educated might do interesting
things betweentimes. As she read further, she
found that the grandfather educated them by taking
them to walk every Sunday and giving them instructive
lectures. Now in Ella’s experience nice
children did not study their lessons on Sunday, neither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
did they go to walk. It is true that occasionally, after
they had been to church and Sunday school, had eaten
the cold Sunday dinner, and had read their Sunday-school
books through, they were allowed to take a
quiet, almost awesome walk up and down the paths
of the nearest cemetery and talk about the flowers or
their books; but this was quite different from an
everyday stroll off into the country.</p>

<p>The four boys and their “Grandpère,” however,
wandered off shamelessly every Sunday—in the
forenoon, too, when by all the customs of Ella’s Sunday
mornings they should have been at church. It
was true that occasionally their grandfather gave
them a moral lecture on a Sunday morning, but these
lectures were often a puzzle to Ella’s eight-year-old
theology. For instance, she had, of course, been taught
to do what she knew was right, but she was quite at
sea when “Jules” confessed that he had struck his
brother, and declared, “laying his hand upon his
heart,” that “something here” told him he had done
wrong. Ella laid her hand over the place where she
supposed her heart to lie, but nothing made any remarks
to her. She concluded that it was because she
was not quite bad enough just then, and she made up
her mind that—although of course she would not do
anything wrong on purpose—yet the next time that
she was naughty, she would watch carefully to see if
she heard any conversation in the vicinity of her
heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>It was somewhat of a pity that Ella’s lessons made
so little impression upon the bulk of “Le Grandpère,”
for it was quite an amazing book, and to know it
would have been a widely distended, if not a liberal
education. It began, indeed, so simply that Ella was
disgusted, for these boys, old enough to live in a
seminary like herself, actually were amazed when
they saw the sun, and appealed to their grandfather to
tell them what it was. Ella did not appreciate the
exigencies of authorship or realize that there must be
something on which to hang a small lecture about the
heavenly bodies.</p>

<p>Further on there were discourses on the five senses,
on how to count, on the history of the French sovereigns;
and then the chapters gradually worked on
through slavery, avarice, extravagance, the massacre
of Saint Bartholomew’s Day, vaccination, and leprosy.
What could have been better for a child? Any
deficiencies that in later times manifested themselves
in Ella’s education may be fairly ascribed to her never
having completed the translation of this profound
volume.</p>

<p>In Ella’s study of French, there was one thing that
puzzled her greatly. She was willing to believe that
French people understood French, but that they ever
really knew it as she knew English without studying
Fasquelle and “Le Grandpère” was something that
she could hardly accept as truth. Then, too, the
mother had told her that she had had a great-great-grandfather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
who was a Frenchman; and she often
wondered whether, if she had lived in his day, they
would have been able to talk together. She could have
said, “Have you the knife of the brother of the carpenter?”
but unless he made the proper reply, “No,
but I have the pencil of the sister of the dressmaker,”
she would not have known what to say next. She
could never have said, “Great-great-grandfather, will
you take me to ride this afternoon?” because that
was not in Fasquelle.</p>

<p>She wondered if the French people really talked
French every day, or only when they had company.
After long deliberation, she came to the conclusion
that they probably <em>talked</em> French all the time, but that
of course they thought in English. These were the
grown-ups. As for the children, no one could expect
them to talk French, certainly not when they were
playing. She wished she had one of them to play with.
It would be almost like meeting her great-great-grandfather
as a little boy.</p>

<p>Of course Ella “practiced.” In the sixties, boys
“took lessons” only if they showed some talent for
music, but girls were expected, talent or no talent, to
spend in solitary confinement two hours a day at hard
labor on the piano. In Ella’s case, the two hours were
lessened to one by her mother’s decree, and “solitary
confinement” was not added to the hard labor, because,
when the sad moment had arrived, a genial
“Bow-wow!” was always heard and a big black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
shaggy head, followed by the rest of a great Newfoundland
dog, pushed open the door. If it chanced
to be the day for Ella’s lesson, Ponto waved a friendly
apology to the teacher and withdrew; but on other
days he stretched himself out under the piano, and
with a sigh of toleration proceeded to sleep away the
time until the hour was up. He never failed to hear
the first stroke of the bell, and if Ella did not stop on
the instant, he slipped his great muzzle under her
wrists and lifted them up from the keys.</p>

<p>Ella, like most children, had a healthy dislike of
practicing. It was such an unmanageable interference
with her plans. “You like French and you like arithmetic,”
said her puzzled teacher; “why is it that
you do not like music?”</p>

<p>Ella pondered a minute, then she said: “It’s because
there isn’t any way to get the better of it. If I
have arithmetic to do, I can work hard and then I can
say, ‘There, you old thing, I’ve done you in half the
time you wanted me to spend, and now Ponto and I
are going to the lake in spite of you.’ But no matter
how hard I practice, an hour is always an hour, and
there isn’t any way to make it shorter.”</p>

<p>Of course Ella hated to count. Bribes were offered.
“My music teacher said that if I would count three
weeks without stopping, she would give me a piece,”
Ella wrote in her little diary. In spite of the promised
“piece,” however, “One, two, three, four,” became
as tiresome as the multiplication table, and at length<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
she invented a way to make the time pass; she played
very loud with one hand and at the same time patted
Ponto with the other.</p>

<p>She felt a little guilty when her music teacher said:
“I heard you practicing two or three measures over
and over this morning, Ella, and I thought what a
good lesson you were going to have to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Ella did not reply, and she forgot to listen to see
whether her heart would make any speeches to her.
She didn’t like practicing, and she didn’t, and when
she heard of remarkable little girls no older than she
who had taken only twelve lessons and could play
“two pieces” already, she did not care very much
that she could play only one. Neither did Ponto.</p>

<p>Ella had a reason for not caring. She firmly expected
that some day, even without that wearisome
“One, two, three, four,” she would play as well as the
little girl with two pieces, perhaps even as well as her
teacher. It was all very simple and very logical. The
teacher wore a ring with a bright red stone in it and
was able to play; by and by <em>she</em> would have a ring
with a bright red stone, and then of course she would
be able to play. Ella knew that the grown-ups
would laugh at her if she told them her fancy, so she
only whispered it into Ponto’s ear. Dogs could
understand, but grown-ups could not.</p>

<p>Like most children, Ella was younger than her
years in some ways and older in others. She could
cherish a belief in the efficacy of a ring to give her
musical ability, and she could sit in a class with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
“ladies and gentlemen” more than twice her age
without a thought of this being anything remarkable.
Of course she knew that the children in the village
went to school with boys and girls of their own years;
but this was nothing; they did one thing and she did
another, that was all. She even took it as a matter of
course when in the “Institute Reporter,” the little
four-page sheet that glorified the seminary with
printers’ ink, she saw her own name among the
other “ladies.” It had, too, a special mark of honor
in the shape of an asterisk indicating that she was
“In studies of the English and Classical graduating
course.” To be sure, no one of her studies was classical,
and she was many years removed from graduation,
but it made one more name on the list.</p>

<p>As to the English, she really wrote with some degree
of correctness because she had never seen writings
that were incorrect, and she was quite aghast when
she first heard the correction of compositions in class.
She wrote to her uncle, “I can’t stop for dates. I want
to tell you what funny compositions some of the
scholars write. One great boy wrote his and commenced
every word with a capital letter. I have not
quite got to doing that.” Ella thoroughly enjoyed
making tiny blankbooks and composing equally tiny
stories carefully adjusted to the little pages. She even
manufactured a paper for children, composing, editing,
and copying it all herself.</p>

<p>Every Monday evening the “Lyceum” was held,
an exercise which was expected to develop the literary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
ability of the students. Ella had joined it as a matter
of course, and when called on for a recitation, she had
given “Over the River” in her best style. When the
second call came, she decided, possibly with a latent
instinct for advertising, to read the first number of her
paper. This was not exactly an innovation, for the
“Lyceum” already rejoiced in a paper called “The
Alpha.”</p>

<p>Ella’s paper was named “Little Pearls.” How the
“ladies and gentlemen” and the august faculty kept
their faces straight during its presentation is a mystery.
It contained a few conundrums, whose answers
were promised “in our next,” but otherwise it was
carefully modeled on the weekly paper of the Sunday
school. There were letters from children with the
patronizing comments of the editor; there was an
original story or two; and the sheet ended with the
tragic tale, drawn from the little editor’s own experience,
of a tiny fish, caught and brought home
from the lake. I fear that the writer had never been
properly trained in “nature study,” for she stated
that the fish jumped out of the water and was found
“lying upon its back,” dead, and she declared,
“although a cat has nine lives, a fish has only one,
and therefore it always stayed dead forever after.”
Whether this literary production lengthened the list
of subscribers, no one can say; but certainly Ella’s
minute cash account showed no marked increase of
income on that date.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE THREE TRAGEDIES OF ELLA’S SEMINARY LIFE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">At the seminary there were only three children besides
Ella. One was two-year-old Nellie, the steward’s
daughter, whom she loved with all her heart. The
second was John, and the third was his little sister,
two years younger than he. For this little sister
there was rarely any real place in Ella’s world; she
was too young for a companion and too old for
a baby; but just as Ned, the steward’s son, fifteen
years old, would sometimes allow Ella, “going on
nine,” to share his amusements, so Ella would occasionally
permit John, “going on seven,” to go to
the lake with her to skip stones, or to the hills for
wild flowers.</p>

<p>The village children all went to the village school,
and Ella seldom saw any of them. The mother had
once known the mother of Dora, daughter of the village
doctor, and it was arranged that the two children
should spend an afternoon together. No one ever
found out exactly what happened, but after this day,
whenever the two little girls passed, they held their
heads very high and swung their short skirts disdainfully,
and looked away from each other.</p>

<p>Soon after this visit, it came to pass that Ella<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
needed to have a tooth out to make way for a newcomer.
“I dare you to go to the doctor and have it
pulled,” said Ned mischievously. Ella would have
felt humiliated not to “take a dare,” and she appealed
to the mother for permission. The mother was
glad to escape the string-and-pull process, and she
hoped that if the children met again, they might become
better friends.</p>

<p>“Was Dora there?” she asked on Ella’s return.</p>

<p>“Yes, she was,” replied Ella with emphasis. “Her
father told her to go out, but she just stayed in the
room every minute. She wanted to hear me cry, but
I wouldn’t. When it was out, she said, just as if she
was glad, ‘Hm! Hurt you some, didn’t it?’ and I
laughed and said, ‘No, not a bit.’” Ella did not add
the fact that going down the doctor’s walk, she had
swung her skirts with more disdain than ever.</p>

<p>The mother looked amused.</p>

<p>“Are you sure that that speech was quite true?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Why, you see, if Dora had not been there, it would
have hurt, of course; but she was there, and so it
didn’t; and anyhow, I wasn’t thinking about it, so I
shouldn’t have known it if it had.” And the mother
was wise enough not to press the question any further.</p>

THEIR SHORT SKIRTS DISDAINFULLY, AND LOOKED
AWAY FROM EACH OTHER</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As has been seen, Ella would have been quite alone
in most of her plays had it not been for Ponto. Fortunately,
a dog is never too old or too young to be a
good friend. People sometimes laugh at a little girl’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>queer notions, but a dog never makes fun of them; he
always understands. Every morning Ponto came upstairs,
thumped on Ella’s door, and waited patiently
till she was ready to go down with him. He was not
allowed in recitation rooms, but everywhere else that
she went, he followed. She greatly enjoyed visiting
the laboratory when her professor was at work.
Ponto would then lie down just outside the door and
take a one-eyed nap, wondering sleepily why she
stayed there instead of coming out of doors.</p>

<p>If the kind professor was at all disturbed by her
presence and her occasional interruptions, he never
let her know it, but answered every question with the
courteous attention that children love, as if their
questions were really worth while. The crowning
glory of her visits came, however, one day when, after
she had asked him something that never would have
occurred to any one but a child, he looked at her
thoughtfully and said, “I don’t know, but I will try
to find out.” This was indeed an honor. The professor
had treated her as if she was a grown-up lady,
and he had met her little query with as much respect
as if the principal himself had asked it. When she
said, “Good-bye. I have an errand in the village,”
and followed the jubilant Ponto down stairs, she held
her small head at least one inch higher than usual.</p>

<p>The errand was closely connected with a big copper
cent which she had held in her hand during her pursuit
of scientific information. Indeed, she had kept close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
watch of it ever since it came into her possession, for
pennies did not come her way every morning. The
grocer kept cassia buds, and these to the little customer
were a luxury far transcending peppermints or
sticks of white candy striped with red, or even chocolate
sticks, which were just coming into fashion.</p>

<p>There were two grocers in the same store. One had
white hair and the other had brown. Ella had tested
them both and had found out that the white-haired
one gave her more cassia buds for a cent than did the
brown-haired one; therefore she waited patiently until
the white-haired one appeared. Then she went back
to the seminary joyfully. She was sure that the generous
dealer had given her more than ever before, and
she would not eat one until she had shown them to
the mother. But alas for the best-laid plans of little
girls as well as mice and men, for when she reached
the seminary, there was not a bud to be seen.
Through a wicked little hole in the pocket every one
had escaped.</p>

<p>This was one of the three tragedies in Ella’s life at
the seminary. The others were even more crushing.
Next to her big doll, her greatest treasure was a paint-box.
She had had paint-boxes before, but this was
the largest and finest she had ever owned. She had
taken the greatest pains to keep it clean, and it was
as fresh and white as when she first unwrapped it.
If the mother had seen, she would have rescued it,
but all her attention was given to a caller; and meanwhile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
his little boy, who had by no means the kind of
soul that scorns a blot, daubed the fair white wood of
the outside of the box with every hue that could be
found within it.</p>

<p>Ella had been out with Ponto, and when she came
in and saw her beloved paint-box in ruins, her grief
was literally too deep for words. The mother had
taken her callers to see the library, and Ella caught
up the ruined treasure and slipped out of doors to
Ponto. She told him all about it; then the two went
to a quiet little place where wild roses grew. With
much difficulty she dug a hole. Therein she laid the
precious paint-box, and with it all the hopes of the
pictures she was going to paint for the uncle in Andover
and the grandmother in the mountains.</p>

<p>The next day, the mother asked, “Where can your
paint-box be? Have you seen it this morning?”</p>

<p>Ella felt rather guilty, but she answered, “No,”
and it was many years before the mother learned the
solution of the mystery.</p>

<p>The third tragedy came from Ella’s ambition to
wear a linen collar. The grown-up girls in school wore
them, and she did so long to have just one. The
mother did not approve; she thought a tiny ruffle for
every day and a bit of lace for best were the only neckwear
proper for a child of eight. Fate, however, promised
to be kind. Ella had acquired some skill in the
making of “perforated paper” bookmarks in the
shape of a cross, elaborately cut out in an openwork<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
pattern; and one Sunday after church a lady in the
village, who knew her wishes, promised her a real
collar of smooth, stiff linen in exchange for one of
these crosses.</p>

<p>Ella was wildly happy, and she wanted to begin the
cross at once; but it was Sunday. Somehow she had
evolved the notion that while it was wrong to play
games on Sunday, it was not wrong to read or write
or, indeed, to do whatever she chose with books or
paper. <em>Perforated</em> paper seemed, however, a little different.
She appealed to the mother, but the mother
often left things for the small girl to think out for herself,
and this was one of them.</p>

<p>“Some people would say it was right, and some
would say it was wrong,” she replied. “Suppose you
decide for yourself, and do what you think is right.”</p>

<p>The little girl decided not to begin the work until
Monday. Surely, she deserved a better reward than
she received, for when the cross was done, the lady
handed her a little flat package done up in white paper
and tied with blue ribbon.</p>

<p>“My sister told me,” she said with a pleasant smile,
“that a linen collar was not at all the thing for a little
girl of eight, and that she was sure you would like
something else better, so I got you this instead.”</p>

<p>Ella took the package with forebodings, which were
justified, for in it was a little white handkerchief. Now
handkerchiefs were things to lose and to have more of;
but a linen collar was a vision, an aspiration, a heart’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>desire. Her face must have shown disappointment,
for the lady hastened to say, “There is a blue flower
worked in one corner.” The lady had taken away her
beautiful dream of being grown up and had given her
instead a handkerchief—with a blue flower in one
corner! These were the three tragedies of Ella’s
first experience in the trials and disappointments of
life.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="facing024" style="max-width: 46.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/facing024.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY SHE DUG A HOLE</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There was, however, a little comforting postscript
to this third tragedy. Among Ella’s accomplishments
was the ability to embroider fairly well those
lines of crescent moons known as scallops. She
marked out a collar on a strip of Marseilles, and by
means of two spools she drew a line of scallops on its
edge. After a season of diligent sewing, she was the
proud owner of a stiff white collar. The mother objected
to her wearing it in public, but she was free to
put it on and stand before her looking-glass and
admire it; and even this was bliss.</p>

<p>Then, too, Christmas was not far away, and its
coming would make up for many troubles. To be
sure, it was not the custom for children to be loaded
down with gifts as they are now, but every one was
to have something, the principal had said so; and Ella
could hardly wait for the day. Nevertheless, in spite
of her impatience, she thoroughly enjoyed herself.
She had never before been in the country in the winter,
and now she coasted on her “Thomas Jefferson”;
she made snow men; she slipped under the branches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
of the pines and firs and hemlocks and shook them
until when she came out her little blue hood was all
powdered with snow; she brought in great armfuls of
creeping Jenny and scarlet alder berries; she broke the
thin ice that formed over the little brooks and delighted
in the fairy palaces of frostwork that it had
concealed. Best of all, however, was the time when
the ice over a shallow pool broke into cakes, and she
could float about on them. What the busy mother
would have said if she had known of all these adventures
is a question; but Ella was well and happy,
and before long Christmas Day came, and in the
evening the big Christmas tree.</p>

<p>Santa Claus, all a-jingle with sleighbells, climbed
in at the window. Ella knew that he was not exactly
a real Santa Claus, but still she felt highly honored
when in his walk about the room he patted her on the
head and asked “How old are you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be nine to-morrow,” she replied; and it almost
made up for the loss of the collar to have him exclaim,
“Nine years old! Why, I thought you were a small
child. I shall have to go pretty deep into my pack to
find anything for a young lady of nine.”</p>

<p>By and by Santa Claus distributed the presents.
In her ante-seminary days, Ella had felt rich if she had
three or four gifts; but now there was a pearl-handled
pen, a little writing-desk with a lock and key; there
were new mittens to match the blue hood; there was a
real jackknife, just such a one as she had been longing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
for, big enough to cut things and not too big to go
into her pocket; there was a box of candy and another
of cassia buds; there was a great package of writing-paper,
some little blankbooks, half a dozen lead
pencils, and a little matchbox of parian marble. Just
why any one should give a small child a matchbox
may be questioned, but Ella did not question it. The
grapes on the cover were pretty, and that was enough.
There was a fine new dress of bright Scotch plaid,
and a “jockey cap” of black velvet with trimmings of
red and black ribbon; and pinned to the cap was a
note from Ella’s dearest little girl friend at the old
home, saying that she had a new cap just like this
one.</p>

<p>There was a little chinchilla muff; and that muff
had a story. The uncle from Andover had rashly
promised to buy whatever she liked best in all Boston.
He had supposed that he could guide her choice toward
the little muff; but of all the glories of Boston
her heart had been set upon a box of tin soldiers. The
tall uncle from Andover scoffed, pleaded, offered
bribes, but the mite of a niece claimed her rights.
“You promised I might have what I wanted, and I
want the tin soldiers,” was her unchanging reply. At
length he started in wrath to return to the study of
theology, and the obstinate little niece called after
him, “Good-bye, uncle; you broke your promise!”
But she had relented sufficiently to send him a gracious
note to the effect that a muff would really be very nice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
to have; he had relented sufficiently to send it to her,
and so peace had come to pass between them.</p>

<p>One more present came to Ella’s share, and that
was a thin, uninteresting envelop. But it was all
glorious within, for here was a bright, fresh two-dollar
bill from her professor. “To spend just as you
like,” the card said. Fairyland had opened, for never
before had Ella owned such an amount of money to
spend as she liked. She had never expected to have so
much, but she had decided long before this what she
would buy if she should ever become a woman of
wealth.</p>

<p>The next day she and the mother talked it over.
The mother, too, had decided what would be the best
way to spend the money. When <em>she</em> was a little girl,
money given to girls was always put into silver
spoons, and now she held before Ella the advantages
of putting the gift into spoons, which she could
always keep and which would always be a remembrance
of the professor.</p>

<p>“But I’d never forget him, anyway,” declared Ella,
“and I don’t want spoons. I want something useful.
Spoons aren’t useful. People just have them on the
table to eat with, and then they go away and forget
them. I want something I’d really use and like to
use and think about using; I want a pair of skates.”</p>

<p>It was against the mother’s inherited ideas of the
desirable, and she was afraid of broken bones and thin
ice and air holes, but the skates were bought. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>had such a multiplicity of green straps as would
arouse a skater of to-day to wrath; but to Ella they
seemed the most beautiful things in the world, and
before long she was gliding over the frozen lake in
perfect bliss.</p>

<span class="fs80">GRADUATION DAY AND ITS MISFORTUNES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The winter was a delight, but the spring and summer
were even more enchanting. The seminary did not
close until late in July, and there was time for the
blooming of more kinds of wild flowers than the little
city girl had ever dreamed of. It was on one of her
fishing trips with Ned that she saw her first lady’s-slipper.
She had left the big rock and was roaming
about under the pines when in a dusky little hollow
she caught sight of a stately pink flower veined with
a darker pink. It rose from two large green leaves,
a queen with her courtiers bowing low before her.
There it stood, elegant, dignified, quietly at ease, although
no other of its kind was in sight. Ella wanted
to break it off and carry it home to show to the
mother, but there was something in the weird grace
of the flower that held her back. She still believed
that there might be a fairyland, and maybe this was
the queen of the fairies. However this might be, she
would not break the stem; she would ask the mother
to come and see the blossom.</p>

<p>Another flower that Ella saw for the first time was
the yellow daisy, the golden rudbeckia. She had no
dream of fairyland about this, for it was a gorgeous,
rollicking yellow blossom, ready to be picked and go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
wherever any one might wish to carry it and to make
friends with anybody. It was away off in the middle
of a field; and although Ella had been taught never to
trample down the tall grass, she could not resist the
temptation to plunge into the midst of it and secure
the wheel of gold that might have come from the end
of the rainbow.</p>

<p>These were the rarities in flowers, but everywhere
there were violets and daisies and anemones and hardhack
and Quaker ladies, and swamp azaleas, and
dandelions and clover and all the other “common
flowers” that are beloved by children. Nestled on the
sunny side of a stone wall at the north of the seminary
there was what had once been a flower bed. Little of
the bed remained except a merry row of white narcissi,
who perked up their red-edged ruffs and nodded their
heads in friendly fashion as the child and the dog drew
near.</p>

<p>Between the narcissi and the gray old stone wall
behind them was Ella’s little burial ground. It happened
sometimes that birds flew against the lighted
windows of the seminary so violently that they were
killed. Ella was always grieved when she found one
lying on the grass, and she chose this bit of ground as
a resting place for them. “Ponto,” she said to the big
shaggy dog, “it was in our Sunday school lesson yesterday
that God always noticed when a little bird fell
to the ground. The teacher said the verse didn’t mean
exactly what it said, because God wouldn’t care for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
birds; but I think it did; and I think He would like it
if you and I made a pretty place for them to lie in.
We’ll do it, won’t we, Ponto?” She held out her
hand to the dog, and he laid his shaggy paw into
it. “I knew you would understand,” said Ella. “I
wonder why dogs and cats and birds and horses
understand so much better than people!”</p>

<p>After this, whenever Ella picked up a little dead
bird, she dug a tiny grave and lined it with fresh green
ferns. She smoothed down the soft feathers, kissed
the pretty little head, and laid the bird softly into its
ferny bed. “A person would have to have a stone
with poetry on it,” she said to Ponto, “but I think a
lovely white narcissus is much prettier for a little bird.
Remember that this is all a secret, Ponto. Nobody
must know anything about it except you and me and
God.”</p>

<p>Down over the hill below the little cemetery was
the island. This was really nothing more than a tussock
just big enough to hold a few bushes, and the
“body of water” which surrounded it was only a bit
of swamp. Ella could easily step across from what
she called the “main land,” but a bridge made the
place seem more like an island, so she laid a board
across the narrow strait. When she was once across
she always drew the board over after her; and then
she stood in a kingdom that was all her own. There
were white violets growing in this island kingdom,
there were ferns and rushes and wild lilies of the valley.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
There was just one Jack-in-the-pulpit, and on its
seminary side Ella had drawn the ferns together so as
to screen it from the eager hands of passers-by.</p>

<p>Then, too, there was the secret, and no one knew of
this save the mother and the professor. On the highest
part of the tiny island, just where the bushes were
thickest, there was a bird’s nest with real eggs, and a
little later, real birds in it. Mother birds are shy of
grown folk, but there are sometimes children of whom
they feel no fear, recognizing perhaps some “call of
the wild” that makes them akin. However that may
be, these birds were not afraid of the little girl who
always spoke to them softly and touched the young
ones as gently as the mother bird herself. They made
no objection when the child carefully lifted the half-grown
fledglings out of the nest; and while she sat
holding them and talking to them, the parent birds
made little flights here and there as if, having now a
reliable nurse for their children, they might allow
themselves a little recreation.</p>

<p>When Ella first saw the young birds with their wide-open
mouths, she was sure that they were dying of
hunger. But what could she give them? She had no
more idea how to feed young robins than young fairies.
There was just one person in the seminary who
could tell her, for he always knew everything; but he
was in a class, teaching some of the big boys algebra.
What algebra was, Ella had no idea; but she was absolutely
certain that it could not be half so important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
as saving the life of a starving bird. She hurried to the
house, and up stairs, then crept silently as a shadow
along the corridor to the recitation room. The door
was wide open. She stood on the threshold a moment,
trying to get her courage up. The young men of the
class smiled, for they were always interested in Ella’s
exploits and wondered what was coming now. The
professor was standing at the board with his back to
the door.</p>

<p>Ella was a little frightened, but she screwed her
courage up and said in a weak, thin little voice,</p>

<p>“Professor, please may I see you only just one minute?
It’s very important.”</p>

<p>The professor came out, and closing the door behind
him, which the students thought was a little
unkind, he asked the visitor what he could do for
her.</p>

<p>“It’s the birds,” she explained. “They were only
eggs, but now they’re little birds, and they’re so hungry
they are starving. I don’t know what to do,” and
the tale ended in what sounded much like the beginning
of a sob.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said the professor gently.
“The mother bird knows how to take care of
them; but if you want to help, just dig some angle
worms and put them on the island where she can
see them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you,” cried Ella. “I knew I must do
something, but I didn’t know what.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>Ella’s mother told her that she ought to apologize
to the professor for interrupting his class. She went
to him obediently and said,</p>

<p>“Professor, I am sorry I interrupted your class, but
I don’t think I did—much—and anyway the birds
had to be fed.”</p>

<p>“So they did,” said the professor kindly, “and
more interruptions of that sort would be better for
birds and for people.”</p>

<p>I am afraid that Ella was not exactly a model child,
for she cut her name on a tree in the circle with the
Christmas jackknife, much to the wrath of the man
who cared for the grounds. She came in promptly
when the mother, for fear of the lightning, called her
in from the piazza during a heavy thunderstorm; but
the next minute she was in the highest cupola. The
time spent in the gloomy basement dining-room
seemed to her so unbearably long that the mother
sometimes yielded to her pleadings and excused her
before the meal was over. This, the principal suggested,
was not quite the thing to do, as it broke up
the “uniformity,” whatever that may have been; so
the mother told her she must remain through the
meal. Ella remained, but she brought a little story-book
and quietly read through the last quarter of an
hour. The big boys smiled in comprehension of the
situation, and the principal made an unconditional
surrender. To Ella he said, “You need not wait if
you would rather go out”; and to the boys, “If you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
would save every minute as that child does, you would
accomplish a great deal more.”</p>

<p>The mother wrote to the grandmother in the
mountains:</p>

<p>“Ella is very obedient, but she always thinks of
something else. I will describe her, so the children
can fancy a little how she looks. She has on a black
beaver cloak, black felt hat trimmed with scarlet
velvet and plumes, a chinchilla muff, and chenille
scarf. She has just come in from church, and now,
before her things are taken off, is reading her Sabbath-school
book. She devours all the books that she finds.”</p>

<p>Ella’s worst—and most innocent—exploit was
her sudden disappearance on the most important day
of the whole school year. The first class was to graduate.
It consisted of two students. One was to have
the valedictory and the other the salutatory; but it
was to be just as real a graduation as if there had been
forty to go out into the world with the seminary’s
blessing upon them.</p>

<p>It was indeed a great day. Every class was to recite.
Compositions were to be read, songs sung, the
piano played, diplomas presented, speeches made,
and trustee meetings held. There was to be a collation,
and the village band was to play while people
ate. Surely nothing could be more festive than this.
The building was crowded with guests. There were
the people of the village, the home friends of the
students, the people who used to be students in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
early days, the thirty-six trustees whose fostering
care was so necessary to the success of the school, and
many other folk who came just because something
was going on and they wanted to be in it.</p>

<p>Everything began finely. At nine, ten, eleven, the
big bell in the belfry rang, and the members of the
first three series of classes made plain to the delighted
visitors how learned the year’s work had made them.
The bell struck twelve. This was the signal for Ella’s
French class, and after that the collation was to come.
But where was Ella? The classes were so small that
the absence of even one student was noticeable, and a
messenger was sent to the mother, who was hearing
her class in botany.</p>

<p>In those days, the more difficult the wording of
a textbook, the more intellectual good those who
studied it were supposed to get from its pages, and a
member of the class in botany was at that moment
declaring that “The cypripedium is perfectly symmetrical,
yet has irregular cohesion in the calyx, great
inequality in the petals, cohesion, adhesion, and metamorphosis
in the—” but the guests were never told
by that class where “cohesion, adhesion, and metamorphosis”
might be found, for their teacher dropped
the book and forgot all about cypripedium and everything
else except that her one little girl was missing.
Ella had established an enviable reputation for punctuality,
and if she was not in her class, then something
had happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>A general alarm was given. Speeches, collation,
graduating exercises were all forgotten, and a search
was begun. The boys and girls and the faculty and the
trustees and the guests all set out to explore the country.
A man at work in a field said that he had seen a
little girl in a red cape going toward the lake; and to
the lake the whole company went. In the moist sand
were prints of little feet going straight to the water’s
edge, and the mother’s face turned white. But beside
them were the marks of Ponto’s sturdy paws.</p>

<p>“The dog is with her,” said the steward. “You
need not be the least bit afraid. Ponto would never
let anything happen to her.”</p>

<p>But the mother was not comforted. Just what dogs
would do, she knew not; but she did know that water
would drown little children.</p>

<p>Some one had caught sight of a child in a Red Riding
Hood cape strolling leisurely down a little hill on
the right. The dog was with her, and they were having
a fine ramble together. The people shouted to her,
and Ponto answered with a deep and surprised “Bow-wow!”
which probably meant,</p>

<p>“Of course I’m glad to see you, but what are you
here for? Can’t you let us take a little walk?”</p>

<p>“Where <em>have</em> you been?” cried the mother, as the
little girl came near.</p>

<p>“Over on the hill to get some flowers,” Ella replied
serenely.</p>

<p>Then the mother told her how the footprints leading
into the water had frightened her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>“Did you think I would walk right into the water
and be drowned?” exclaimed Ella in disgust. “A baby
a week old wouldn’t be so silly as to do that. I walked
ever so far close to the water, but I suppose it washed
the footprints away.” This was just what had happened,
but no one had noticed that the wind was
blowing toward the land. As to the French class, the
mother had told her that it would meet at two in the
afternoon, and when the hour was changed to twelve,
she had forgotten to notify the small pupil, and then
in the fear and confusion forgot that she had forgotten.</p>

<p>So they all went back through the lane to the seminary
to gather up the fragments of the great day.
The French class never welcomed its guests with a
“Comment vous portez-vous, mesdames et messieurs?”
but the collation was still palatable, the
speeches were made, the valedictory and the salutatory
were read, the band played the pieces they had
been practicing, and the two students were as thoroughly
graduated as if a little girl in a Red Riding
Hood cloak had not interfered with the proceedings.</p>

<p>The mother had decided to return to the city, and
this was Ella’s last day at the seminary, and the end
of her first year of school life. She would have been
broken-hearted over leaving, had it not been that she
was going to visit her grandmother; and a month
with a grandmother will make up to little girls for
many losses.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br>
<span class="fs80">ON THE WAY TO GRANDMOTHER’S</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">There were two grandmothers. The one with white
curly hair that glistened in the sunshine lived in the
village where Ella was born. It was a pretty village
with hills and brooks and winding roads and meadows
of flowers, and old-fashioned houses with piazzas
and tall white pillars. Back of Ella’s home was
a hill where great apple trees grew, and the very first
thing that she remembered in the world was her father’s
lifting her up into one of them, all sweet and
dainty with pink-and-white blossoms, and telling her
to pick as many as she pleased.</p>

<p>When they went to the grandmother’s, they walked
straight up the village street, where a line of houses
stood on one side and woods on the other. They were
beautiful woods. Columbines grew in the clefts of the
rocks, delicate pink windflowers blossomed in the little
glades and the brave and cheery dandelions came
out to the very edge of the road to give a welcome to
those who loved them.</p>

<p>The mother had told her little daughter that one of
the names of the columbine was Aquilegia Canadensis;
of the windflower was Anemone Nemorosa; and of
the dandelion was Taraxacum Officinale, just for the
pleasure of seeing how so small a child would manage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
the long names. Ella felt especially well acquainted
with those flowers whose “company names,” as she
said, she had learned; and when she was alone with
them and talked to them, she often called them by
these names and pretended that she had come to
make a call. “Miss Anemone Nemorosa,” she would
say, “are you sure that you are feeling quite well to-day?”
or, “Miss Aquilegia Canadensis, I think I saw
a cousin of yours in the garden just now. Your dress
is red and yellow, but hers was pink. Maybe she was
your sister.” She fancied that they liked the little
formality, and she was almost surprised that they did
not answer her questions.</p>

<p>Beyond the woods was a bridge hanging high over a
deep black river. Ella did not like dark, still water;
and when they were crossing this bridge, she always
held fast to her mother’s or her father’s hand. After
they had crossed the bridge, they went up a little hill,
not by the road, but through a field and over ledges
where the sweet-smelling saxifrage grew; and then
they came to grandmother’s little wooden gate that
always closed of itself after they had gone through it.</p>

<p>They passed the balm of Gilead tree with its sticky
buds, the black currant bush, and the great bush of
white roses with creamy centers. Then Ella ran
across the grass to the door, for grandmother was almost
sure to see them and to come to the doorway to
give them a welcome.</p>

<p>Grandmother’s house was one of a little group of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
white houses standing on the ledges at the top of the
hill. These formed the tiny village within a village
which was called the “New City.” Ella was always
so happy at her grandmother’s that long after she
was old enough to go to Sunday school, she always
confused the “New City” with the “New Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>This was the “village grandma,” as Ella called her.
But there was also the “mountain grandma,” and it
was to her house that the little girl and her mother
were going. Now when good New Englanders are
starting for anywhere, they always begin by taking
the morning train to Boston; so of course that was
what our two travelers did.</p>

<p>Going to Boston, even if she did not go any farther,
was a great treat to Ella. There were windows full of
blankbooks, and what stories she could write in them,
she thought longingly. There were whole stores full
of toys; and in the window of one of these stores lay a
box of tin soldiers. Ella looked again. It was exactly
like the box that she had wanted. Maybe it was the
very same one. It certainly was the same store.</p>

<p>“Mother,” she said, “that is my box of tin soldiers
that uncle did not give me; but I’m so old now that I
don’t care for it. I’d rather have the muff.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you love your uncle enough to forget that?”
her mother asked.</p>

<p>“I love him better than almost anybody in the
world,” said Ella, “and I do forget it except when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
happen to think of it. But he really did break his
promise,” she added slowly.</p>

<p>They left the stores and went to the Common.
Ella’s little book of history said that in the Revolutionary
War the Americans pitched their tents on the
Common; and she fancied that she knew just where
those tents stood. She had also read about the battle
of Bunker Hill, and she never felt that she was really
in Boston until she had caught sight of the monument
in memory of it standing tall and gray against the
northern sky.</p>

<p>At one side of the Common was the Capitol. The
mother told Ella that the laws for the whole State of
Massachusetts were made in that building.</p>

<p>“Do they ever make a mistake and make a bad
law?” asked Ella.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they do sometimes,” the mother replied
rather unwillingly, for she wanted her little girl to
grow up with deep respect for the institutions of her
country.</p>

<p>Ella thought a minute; then she asked slowly,</p>

<p>“If they made a law that everybody must tell lies,
which would be naughtier, to obey it or not to obey
it?”</p>

<p>Just then a man began to scatter grain for the
pigeons, and Ella forgot all about laws whether
good or bad.</p>

<p>Of all the pleasures of Boston, there was one that
Ella wanted more than she had wanted the tin soldiers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
but she feared she would never be permitted to
enjoy it. This pleasure was, to have just one ride in
the swan boats in the Public Garden. The mother was
afraid of boats, especially of little ones, and Ella saw
no hope of the ride that she wanted so badly.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t I go for just one minute?” she pleaded.
“I couldn’t possibly drown in one minute if I tried.
Couldn’t I just get in and get out again?”</p>

<p>But the mother had no idea how deep the water
might be, and she always answered,</p>

<p>“No, not until you are tall enough to wade out if
the boat tips over.”</p>

<p>“But I’ll be a woman then,” said Ella, “and tall
women don’t ride in the swan boats.”</p>

<p>“You can take some little girl with you, and maybe
the man with the boat will think you are a little girl
too.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to take a little girl. I want
some one to take me while <em>I</em> am a little girl. I don’t
care for the tin soldiers now, and I’m afraid that by
and by I shan’t care for the swan boats; and then I
shan’t ever have had a ride in them, and I’ll be sorry
all my life that I had to leave it out.”</p>

<p>But the mother was turning toward the railroad
station. There would be only time enough to go
there and to get some lunch, she said, and they must
not stay in the Garden any longer.</p>

<p>After lunch they went on board the train, and before
long they had crossed the line and were in New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
Hampshire. Ella had a tiny yellow-covered geography
at home, and she knew from the map just how New
Hampshire ought to look. It ought to look like a tall,
narrow chair with a very straight back. But from
the car window it looked like wide fields of grass and
clover and daisies and hills and brooks and valleys.
Here and there were great elms, their branches swaying
gracefully in every breeze. Along the rail fences
were bushes of what Ella was almost certain were
blackberries, and nearly ripe. There were deep woods,
too, and now and then she caught a glimpse of a
gleaming yellow or white blossom as the train hurried
onward. Sometimes they rode for quite a long way
beside the blue Merrimack River. It was low water,
and she could see the markings that the current had
left on the sand. They were just like the markings in
the little brooks that she always liked so much, only
these were larger.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon they came to Concord, and
the mother’s friend met them at the station. But what
did this mean? Ella’s eyes grew bigger and bigger, for
the friend held by the hand a little girl about as tall as
Ella. After she had greeted them, she said to Ella,</p>

<p>“This little girl has come to live just across the
street from us, and I am sure that you will be good
friends. Her name is Ida Lester, and she has come to
meet you and walk home with you.”</p>

<p>So the mother and her friend walked up the shady
street, and the two little girls walked along behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
them, looking shyly at each other. Ella liked Ida,
and Ida liked Ella.</p>

<p>“Do you like checkerberry candy?” asked Ella.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” Ida replied. “I had a stick of red and
white peppermint candy yesterday.”</p>

<p>“A lady on the cars gave me some checkerberry
candy,” said Ella. “I wish I had saved half of it for
you.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had saved half of mine for you,” said
Ida heartily. “I will next time. Are you going to
live here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” replied Ella. “We are just going to make
a little visit, and then we’re going to see my grandmother
in New Hampshire.”</p>

<p>“But <em>this</em> is New Hampshire,” said Ida, looking
puzzled.</p>

<p>“Is it? I know it said ‘New Hampshire’ on the
tickets, but I don’t call it ‘New Hampshire’ till I get
where my grandmother is. But I’d just as soon,” she
added quickly, for she was afraid she had not been
exactly polite to this new friend, “and I’m so glad you
live here.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’ve come,” said Ida. “Did you bring
your dolls? Do you like to play ‘house’ or ‘school’
better?”</p>

<p>“I like to play both,” said Ella. “I brought my
big doll, because she is the one I sleep with and the
one I love best.”</p>

<p>“What is her name?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“Minnie May Ida May. I like ‘May’ and that’s
why I put it in twice.”</p>

<p>“You put in my name, too,” cried Ida joyfully.
“I am so glad you chose it even before you ever saw
me. I’m going to name my biggest doll over again,
and call her Minnie May Ella May.”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t room for any more dolls in the
trunk,” said Ella, “but I brought ever so many paper
dolls and some pretty paper to make them some more
dresses. I’ll give you some.”</p>

<p>“Oh, good!” Ida exclaimed. “My front steps are a
splendid place to play with paper dolls; and there’s a
deep dark crack where we can put them when they
are naughty. We’ll have to tie a string around them
though, so we can pull them up again. Come over
now, will you? No, I forgot. My father raised some
beans and they got mixed. He told me to pick them
over this afternoon and put all the white ones in one
box, the yellow in another, and the pink in another.
He’s going to plant them in the spring.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help you,” Ella cried eagerly, “and we’ll play
that we are in a castle where a wicked giant lives, and
that he will whip us just dreadfully if we make any
mistakes; and we’ll be thinking up some plan to get
away from him.”</p>

<p>And so it was that the two little girls became
friends. They had fine times together playing
“house” and “school,” and working on bits of canvas
with bright-colored worsteds in cross stitch, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
telling stories to each other. Sometimes they wrote
their stories and read them to the long rows of paper
dolls standing up against the steps. Ella had a great
admiration for Ida’s handwriting. Ella’s own writing
had perhaps improved a very little, but even now it
looked much like a fence that had been caught in
an earthquake, its pickets and rails sticking out in
all directions; but Ida’s was fair and round and looked
quite as if she was grown up.</p>

<p>One reason why they liked to write stories was because
they always tied the tiny books together with
bright ribbons. Ida had a big box of odds and ends of
ribbon, and these she shared generously with Ella.
They had been given to her by her Sunday school
teacher, who had a little millinery store. Ella did not
wish to give up her own Sunday school teacher, but
she did think it would be very agreeable if she would
open a millinery store.</p>

<p>The two little girls did all sorts of pleasant things
together. When Saturday came, Ida ran across the
street, her face all aglow with smiles, and gave Ella’s
mother a note. Ella could hardly wait till her mother
had read it, and she stood first on one foot, then on the
other. The note said,</p>

<p>“Will you please let Ella put on a big apron and
come to dinner with Ida to-day?”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, may I go? May I? May I? <em>May I?</em>”
cried Ella, dancing about the room. “I know we are
to do something nice. What is it, Ida?”</p>

SURE THAT ALL WAS GOING ON WELL</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>Ida only laughed, but the mother said yes, and the
girls ran across the street and pinned on the big
aprons. Then Ida opened a door into a little room
back of the kitchen that Ella had never seen.</p>

<p>“This is the Saturday room,” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s lovely!” Ella cried. “I never saw such
a beauty. Can you really do things with it?”</p>

<p>“Just like a big one,” replied Ida, “and every
Saturday mother lets me cook my dinner on it.”</p>

<p>“It” was a little cookstove, the top not much more
than a foot square. It had four little griddles and an
oven and a little stovepipe that opened into the pipe
of the big stove in the kitchen. Beside the stove was
a small closet, and on the low hooks hung a mixing-spoon,
a steel fork and knife, a griddle, and a wire
broiler. On the shelf above was a mixing-bowl, a
little cake pan, a small kettle, and a muffin pan that
was just large enough to hold six muffins. Above
these was a pretty set of blue-and-white dishes, and
small knives, spoons, and forks. In one corner of the
room was a table, and in its drawers were napkins
and a tablecloth.</p>

<p>“And does your mother really let you get your own
dinner?” cried Ella.</p>

<p>“Yes, she does,” said Ida. “She says that little
girls always like to cook, and they may as well learn
the right way as to play with scraps of dough that
their mothers have made. We’re going to have steak
and sweet potatoes and lettuce to-day, and blackberries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
and cream for our dessert. I made the fire
before I came over, and the potatoes are all washed
and ready to boil.”</p>

<p>“And may I help?” cried Ella.</p>

<p>“Of course you may. If you will put the potatoes
into the kettle, I will wash the lettuce. We’ll set the
table together, and then you shall broil the steak
while I go to mother’s refrigerator for the blackberries
and the cream.”</p>

<p>Once in a while Ida’s mother looked in at the door
to make sure that all was going on well, and when the
little girls had sat down to the table, she came and
looked it over and said,</p>

<p>“Well, children, I think you have done everything
as well as I could. I should really like to sit down and
eat dinner with you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do, do!” the girls cried; but Ida’s mother only
smiled and shook her head.</p>

<p>“Your father will be here soon,” she said, “and I’m
afraid there would not be enough for us all. When
you are a little older, you shall cook a dinner for us
some day, and if Ella is here, we will ask her to come
and help.”</p>

<span class="fs80">THE REAL NEW HAMPSHIRE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">On Ella’s side of the street, as well as on Ida’s, interesting
things were often going on. The mother and
her friend were making wax flowers, and this was a
delight to see. Ella thought that the pink mossrose
buds were the loveliest things in the world. The
mother had brought with her some thin sheets of
white wax, and out of these she cut the petals, using
the real buds for patterns. Some people made the
petals of pink wax, but it was thought to be much
more artistic to make them of white and paint them
with pink powder.</p>

<p>These were pressed into the hollow of the hand and
bent around the wire stem. Real moss from the north
side of the beech tree was twisted on at the base of
the petals. Leaves were made by dipping real rose
leaves first into water, then into melted green wax
and peeling off the impression of the under side to use.
The rosebuds and the sprays of leaves were brought
gracefully together, and there was the bouquet, all
ready to take its stand in a little vase under a glass
shade on the parlor mantel.</p>

<p>Wax pond lilies, with long stems of green rubber,
were also made. The stems were coiled upon a round
piece of looking-glass to represent water. A glass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
shade in the shape of a half sphere was placed over
them, finished with a chenille cord. “And there you
have a thing that will always be an ornament for your
parlor,” said the teachers of wax-flower-making. “It
will never go out of fashion because it is true to
nature.”</p>

<p>The two grown-ups were very kind to the smaller
folk. They let them try and try until they had each
made a really pretty bud and a spray of leaves to go
with it. Then they made some little forget-me-nots
and some syringas. This was as much as they could
find time for without neglecting their large families of
dolls.</p>

<p>One day Ella’s mother and her friend planned to go
a little way out of the city to call on an old friend of
theirs.</p>

<p>“Put on your blue-and-white checked silk and your
leghorn hat,” said the mother.</p>

<p>“Do I have to go?” Ella asked in dismay, for she
and Ida had some interesting plans for the afternoon.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said her mother. “This lady is an old
friend, and she will want to see you.”</p>

<p>“Would she want to see me if she knew that I
didn’t want to come?”</p>

<p>“I really can’t say about that,” said the mother
with a smile, “but I’ll tell you something that I do
know. I have noticed that when little girls do a thing
because their mothers want them to, something
pleasant is almost sure to happen before long.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>Ella did not know of anything pleasant that would
be likely to happen in this call, and nothing did happen.
The lady did not seem especially glad to see her.
There was not a child or a cat or a dog to play with.
There were a few books, but they were shut up in a
tall bookcase with glass doors, and Ella was almost
sure that it would not do to ask if she might take one
to read. She sat in a stiff chair by the window, thinking
of what she and Ida had meant to do. After a
long, long time they said good-bye and started for
home.</p>

<p>On the way Ella picked up a little stone and asked
her mother if it was a fossil.</p>

<p>“Here’s a gentleman who will tell you,” said
mother’s friend, and she introduced a tall man with
white hair and deep blue eyes who was coming toward
them.</p>

<p>“Doctor,” she said, “here is a little girl who wants
to know whether her stone is a fossil.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said he with a kindly look at Ella. “I
am afraid it is not; but what does she know about
fossils?”</p>

<p>“Very little,” said her mother; “but even when she
was very small, she was always bringing in pebbles
and asking if they did not have names just as flowers
did. Her father told her the names of a few of the
minerals that were most common about our home,
and she is always looking for them.”</p>

<p>“I think I must give myself the pleasure of showing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
her my cabinets,” said the Doctor. “Not many little
girls care for minerals. May I take her home with me
now?”</p>

<p>Then came a happy time. The Doctor had great
cases full of the most interesting minerals. He soon
found that Ella liked fossils and crystals especially,
and as he showed them to her one by one, he told her
stories of the places where he found them and of the
fossils that were once living plants or animals a long,
long time ago.</p>

<p>“Was it before you were born?” Ella asked, and
wondered a little why he looked so amused when he
answered yes.</p>

<p>When it was time for her to go home, the Doctor
gave her a real fossil, a piece of rose quartz, and a little
deep red garnet. He walked home with her, and when
he left her, he said:</p>

<p>“I am going away in the morning, but I shall send
you before long a package of specimens marked with
their names and where they were found. Maybe some
day we shall have a great mineralogist whose name
will be Ella. I take off my hat to the mineralogist of
the future,” he said with a friendly smile.</p>

<p>Ella was the happiest little girl in town. “He took
off his hat to me just as if I had been a grown lady,”
she told her mother.</p>

<p>The Doctor kept his promise, and not long afterwards
he sent her a package of fifty or sixty minerals,
all marked as he had said they would be. Ella wrote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
him a little letter, in her funny handwriting that
looked as if it had been out in an earthquake, and told
him how pleased she was to have them, and how much
she liked to look them over. One thing puzzled her,
however. The good Doctor must have forgotten for a
moment what a little girl she was, for he had put into
the package a pamphlet that he had written for some
learned society about the cacao tree. It was a thick
pamphlet in the finest of print and with the lines very
close together.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell him that I am glad to have this to
read,” said Ella in dismay, “for I’m not. What shall
I do?”</p>

<p>“It was kind in him to send it to you,” her mother
replied, “and you can thank him for his kindness.
That will be perfectly honest. You need not tell him
that you will enjoy reading it.”</p>

<p>Ella was having a good time, but when night came,
she was often a little homesick for the grandmother
and the “real New Hampshire,” and she did not
grieve when she and her mother took the train for the
mountains. She was very sorry to leave Ida, but the
mother had promised her friend to stop on her way
home. Ella had agreed to bring Ida some maple
sugar; and the two little girls said good-bye without
any tears. They exchanged parting gifts. Ella gave
Ida “Minnie Warren,” her very best paper doll,
and Ida gave Ella a little book with a story in it that
she had written. It was tied with a bright red ribbon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
and on the cover was written, “The Lost Child,
A True Story Made up by Ida Lester.”</p>

<p>After an hour in the cars, Ella and her mother came
to the most delightful part of the journey. The train
stopped, then rushed on toward the north, leaving
them standing beside a wharf that stretched out into
a beautiful lake, blue as the sky and full of dainty little
islands all rocks and trees and ferns. The lake
seemed to have been dropped softly into a hollow
among the mountains, for they were all around it,
bending over it as if they loved it, Ella thought.</p>

<p>A shining white steamboat was coming into sight
around an island. It did not blow any whistle, but
floated up to the wharf as gracefully as a swan, making
only the gentlest of ripples in the blue water. This
was the “Lady of the Lake.” Ella thought the name
had been given to the boat because it seemed so gentle
and so ladylike.</p>

<p>They went on board, and as the steamboat made a
wide curve away from the wharf and set out on her
course across the blue water, roaming in and out
among the islands, Ella joyfully watched for the
peaks that she knew best in the ranges that circled
around the old homestead. From one point on the
steamer’s course Mt. Washington could be seen for a
few minutes. Ella was looking for it eagerly when she
saw a man with a harp coming up from the lower
deck. A little girl followed him, and as he began to
play, she sang in a sweet, clear voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>“Mother,” Ella whispered, “couldn’t I ever learn
to sing like that? I’d rather do it than almost anything
else in the world.”</p>

<p>The singing stopped and the man passed his hat
around for money. Ella looked at the little singing
girl and found that the singer was looking at her.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t I go and speak to her?” she asked, and
her mother said, “Yes, if you like. I think she looks
rather lonely.”</p>

<p>So Ella went up to the singing girl a little shyly and
said:</p>

<p>“I think your singing is beautiful. I wish I could
go about and sing and be on a boat always.”</p>

<p>“I heard you say to your mother that you were going
to your grandmother’s, and I wished and wished
that I had a grandmother and could go to see her and
play like other children. I’d so much rather than to
go about singing.”</p>

<p>But the father was beckoning to her to get ready to
go ashore, and Ella went back to her mother.</p>

<p>“I can see him! I can see him!” she cried. “And
there’s the gray horse!”</p>

<p>One of her uncles always met them at the Harbor.
Ella had caught sight of him on the wharf, and she
had no more thought just then for the singing girl.</p>

<p>Pretty soon they were seated in the wagon and
were riding slowly along the road that wound higher
and higher up among the hills to the old homestead.
It was good to go slowly, Ella thought, for every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
mountain and every tree seemed like an old friend,
and it would hurt their feelings if she hurried past
them.</p>

<p>There were two roads that found their way to “the
West,” that is, the little village that was nearest to
the homestead, and it was always a question which to
choose. One led over a hill so high that it was almost a
young mountain. Indeed, when Ella was smaller, she
had fancied that if the road had not held it down like
a strap, it would have grown into a mountain. The
other road was shorter, but full of rocks, as if it had
once been the bed of a river. The horse knew it well.
He had learned just how to twist and turn among the
rocks, and even if one wheel was a foot higher than
another, there was no real danger of an overthrow,
day or night.</p>

<p>Upward they went, past tiny villages, little blue
ponds, comfortable farmhouses, usually in charge of a
big dog, who came out to the road and greeted them
with a friendly wag of the tail; past meadows and
mowing lots; beside “sap orchards” of maple trees;
through deep woods, dark and cool even that warm
summer afternoon; past the tiny red schoolhouse under
the maples at the crossroads. Ella had been there
to school with an older cousin one day, and she
thought that going to school and sitting at a desk
must be the most delightful thing in the world. She
had been allowed to sit, not with the little children,
but, because she was company, on the high seats at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
the back of the room with the big girls. They were
parsing in “Paradise Lost.” Ella had no idea what
either “Paradise Lost” or “parsing” might be, but
she was sure it must be something very agreeable.
They had carried their dinner in a tin pail; and this,
she thought, was a wonderfully fine thing to do, for
when noon came, they ate it under the trees just as if
they were on a picnic. Then they played in the brook
and made playhouses, marking them out with white
stones on the grass. They made wreaths of maple
leaves, pinning them together with their long stems,
and they pulled up long sprays of creeping Jenny to
drape over their playhouses at home.</p>

<p>But now they were on the crossroad that led to
grandmother’s, and Ella was getting much excited.
“I know she will hear us when we go over the causeway,”
she cried, “and she will come to the road to
meet us;” and so it was, for two minutes later they
could see the end of the house and the big asparagus
bush standing under one of the west windows. Half a
minute more, and they were at the gate, and there
stood grandma and grandpa, and the uncles and the
aunts and the cousins, and such a welcome as there
was! Then came supper, with cottage cheese, made as
no one but grandma could make it, custard pie, hot
biscuit and maple syrup made from the sap of the
very trees that they had just passed, and as many
other good things as the table would hold.</p>

<p>After Ella was curled up in bed that night, she said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>“Mother, I don’t believe I want to sing on a boat.
I’d rather be a little girl at her grandmother’s. Will
you please take out my thick shoes? I shall be too
busy to look for them in the morning.”</p>

<p>The mother went back to have a little talk alone
with grandmother. She was sitting in her straight-backed
rocking-chair. There were tears in her eyes.
She looked up as the mother came in.</p>

<p>“The child looks more like her father every year,”
said grandmother.</p>

<p>The mother nodded. Her eyes, too, were full of
tears, and she could not speak.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
<span class="fs80">BOY COUSIN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Ella was a fortunate little girl in having so many
cousins. Some were tall, some were short; some had
blue eyes, and some had black; some had curly hair
and some had straight hair; some lived near the
grandfather’s, some lived a long drive away, and
some lived many hundreds of miles away. Most of
them were younger; two or three were older. When
one is nine, three or four years make a great difference,
and Ella looked upon these older ones as being
quite mature persons. She loved them all, but her
special playmate was Boy Cousin, a boy of her own
age who lived nearest.</p>

<p>When morning came, there were so many interesting
things to do that Ella hardly knew how to choose
among them. First of all, she must of course have a
good long look at the mountains, every one of them.
Little girl as she was, she could remember when some
of them were a little different in their appearance.
The nearest one was Ossipee, a kindly, friendly, sunny
mountain, with a great pasture running far up the
side to a gray rock that looked quite like a cabin.
This had not come into view until the trees about it
had been cut down. The children realized that the
“cabin” was much larger than it appeared, and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
had made up a story to the effect that a good-natured
giant from the other side of the mountain had come
over to this side, bringing his house with him.</p>

<p>Beyond this rock were ledges, and after a rain the
water ran down over them in a silver sheet. The children
called them the Shining Rocks, the home of the
sunbeam fairies. They had once climbed to the top of
the mountain, and when they came to the rocks, they
more than half expected to catch a glimpse of a little
man in grass-green hat or a dainty fairy queen in
a gown of sunbeams. No fairies appeared, and they
decided that it was foolish to expect them, for every
one ought to know that they will not appear when
grown-ups are about.</p>

<p>To the west lay Israel, massive and dignified. That
had not changed; but Ella felt sure that Whiteface
was not quite the same. It was called Whiteface because
a slide many years before had torn off the
face of the mountain, and left only the bare white
granite. Every summer the trees and bushes made
their way a little farther in upon the rocks; and a
keen observer could really see that the slide was a
little less white and a little more green.</p>

<p>Away to the north was Chocorua, the mountain
that in sun and shade and mist and tempest and calm
was always an exquisite picture. It lay with quiet
majesty on the horizon, stately and beautiful. The
forest had crept up the sides, but the summit was a
great mass of granite, sharply pointed and reaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
far up into the blue sky. Ella thought it looked like a
picture that she had seen of the Alps. She did so hope
that some day she might climb it. It would be like
taking a trip to Europe, she thought. Of all the mountains
in view, Chocorua was the one that she loved
best. “I wish you could understand. I wish I could
put my arm around you and tell you how I love you,”
she used to whisper to it sometimes. The mountain
looked more and more beautiful, but it made no reply.
One day, however, a wisp of white cloud floated
quickly over the peak while she was speaking. “You
do understand, and you are waving to me,” she said
to the mountain, and after this she loved it more than
ever.</p>

<p>Ella had been walking slowly down the narrow road
that wound between the tall alder bushes down to the
river. At one place she stopped to put aside the ferns
growing in front of a rock of pale gray granite. The
side of the rock nearest the road was of a darker gray
and was shaped like a door. This was the entrance to
fairyland, the children had decided, and Ella stood
waiting a moment to see if the queen of the fairies
would appear. If the queen should wear a bright pink
dress with deep red lines, then Ella would know for
sure that she had seen her Majesty in the little woods
by the lake near the seminary.</p>

<p>But Boy Cousin was coming up the road, and Ella
hastily brought the ferns together, for she had begun
to suspect that he did not believe in fairies quite so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
firmly as she, so she did not speak of them when they
met on the bridge.</p>

<p>This bridge was made of split logs laid upon great
rough beams of wood. On each side there was a rail
cut with many initials. Among them was a big “E,”
which Ella had cut the summer before. Under the
bridge, as far up and down stream as they could see,
there were rocks of all sizes and shapes. It was so dry
a season that in many places the water had slipped
out of sight among them, making a fresh, merry,
rippling sound.</p>

<p>“It’s playing hide and seek,” declared Boy Cousin,
“and it is saying, ‘Here I am! Find me if you can!’”</p>

<p>Over the river hung wild grapes, as yet green and
sour; sprays of goldenrod; graceful and dainty white
birches; and here and there was a bright leaf or two of
the early autumn, or a reddening spray of bittersweet
or the scarlet berries of the black alder.</p>

<p>The children slipped down beside the bridge to one
of their favorite places, a big flat rock overhung by a
white birch and a maple. They were looking up
through the branches when Ella exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Just see there, Boy Cousin! See the blue sky with
the white birch bough running across it and the little
spray of red maple leaves! It’s our flag, our own Red,
White, and Blue. But let’s go and see the stone house.
We can come back here this afternoon.”</p>

<p>So down the road they went. On the left was a little
hill where lay some great-great-grandfathers, men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
who had forced their way into the new country and
cut out for themselves homes in the wilderness. Their
graves were marked by field stones, just as they had
been left in the early times. At one or two of them an
initial was rudely cut into the stone. Ella wondered a
little whether she would have liked these great-great-grandfathers
or her French ones better. “I had some
French great-great-grandfathers, too,” said Boy
Cousin. “What a pity that we couldn’t all have
lived at the same time!”</p>

<p>On the right of the road was a row of tamarack
trees, and over the wall a field through which the river
ran in graceful curves, and a mass of great rocks that
looked as if hurled together by an earthquake, but
made the nicest places possible for little “cubby
houses” and ovens for baking mud cakes.</p>

<p>Through the bars the children went, over a little
bridge, across the wide-spreading meadow, and up a
hill to a rocky pasture where the gray horse was roaming
about.</p>

<p>“The horse and the rocks are the very same color,”
said Ella. “I don’t see how you know which of them
to put the bridle on when you go to catch him.”</p>

<p>“That’s easy,” replied Boy Cousin. “I just look
the rocks over, and put the bridle on the one that
shakes its tail.”</p>

<p>There was one rock, larger than the others, and of
all the rocks that the children had seen, this was the
only one that split into layers. Wide slabs of this rock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
lay all around, and of these slabs they had made, the
summer before, a little cottage. It stood up against
the great rock, with a slab of granite for each wall and
one for the roof. By patient hammering they had
contrived to break out a place for a doorway and a
window. It was so well built that it had stood bravely
through all the frosts and storms of a mountain
winter.</p>

<p>“It looks just exactly as it did,” Ella said delightedly.
“I was afraid it would fall down. I wonder that
the ram did not knock it down.”</p>

<p>Boy Cousin was silent. He was never inclined to
brag of his own exploits. Ella went on: “Grandpa
told me last night. He said that the ram kept trying
to butt you, and that you hadn’t anything to fight it
with except a little stick; but that you climbed up on
this rock and managed somehow to keep it off till
your father came from the next field. He said you
were a plucky boy, or you would have been killed.”</p>

<p>“Who wouldn’t be plucky rather than killed?” demanded
the hero of the story. “There’s no end of
checkerberries over there. Let’s make a birch-bark
basket and pick some.”</p>

<p>They pulled some birch bark from a tree, took a
piece seven or eight inches long and five wide, cut two
slits an inch long in each end, bent the outer pieces on
either end together, and fastened them with a little
wooden pin; and there they had a strong basket that
would hold a double handful of checkerberries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>After the berries were picked, Boy Cousin looked
wisely at the sun and declared that it was time to go
home to dinner.</p>

<p>“Let’s go fishing after dinner,” Ella proposed.</p>

<p>“No good; too early. Let’s play croquet first.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t any croquet set.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I, though? You just come and see.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t have last summer.”</p>

<p>“This is another summer.”</p>

<p>“Have you really a set?”</p>

<p>“You said I hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll say you have if you have. Where is it?”</p>

<p>“It’s where little girls can’t find it; but if you’ll
come down this afternoon, we’ll play and I’ll beat you
with it whether it’s real or not.”</p>

<p>“I don’t more than half believe it’s real, but I’ll
come. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>When Ella came to see the croquet set, she thought
it was quite wonderful.</p>

<p>“It isn’t the least bit like those in the stores,” she
explained to her mother. “It is ever and ever so much
nicer because it is so different. He just sawed off
pieces of white birch for the mallet heads, bored a
hole in each one, and drove the handle in. The bark is
left on, and it’s so much prettier than paint and varnish.
The ends are not much smoothed off, and so the
balls do not slip half so badly.”</p>

<p>“And how did he make the balls?” asked the
mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>“Why, he didn’t have to make them at all. There
was an old bedstead, and these balls were at the top of
the posts. He just sawed them off. They’re not like
common balls; they are shaped like those that boys
play football with, and when you hit one, you never
know which way it will go. It’s ever so much more
fun than just plain croquet.”</p>

<p>There was always plenty of amusement for the two
children, and no one ever heard them saying, “Please
tell me something to do.” No one ever heard them
wishing for more children to play with. Indeed, the
river was as good as a dozen. They cut poles in the
woods and fished in it. Ella kept a little diary, as was
the fashion in those times, and it was a great convenience
to be able to fill a whole day’s space with such
entries as, “I caught 2 flatfish and 1 perch”; or, when
apparently the fish had refused to bite on the previous
day, “We did not go fishing to-day at all. I suppose
I should not have caught anything if we had
gone.”</p>

<p>The river had a charming way of suggesting things
to do. In one place, clay stones had formed, and the
children had fine times wading in and picking them
up. In another it had overflowed and made a little
bay that could easily be shut off by itself. They
named it Beauty Bay, and whenever they caught a
fish without harming it, they slipped it gently into
this Bay to live in peace and plenty all the rest of its
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>A big flat rock in the middle of the stream was their
picnic ground. Here they often built a fire and roasted
eggs rolled in wet paper or ears of fresh green corn.
On the bank just beyond the rock were blackberry
bushes, and no one who has not tried it has any idea
how good the berries taste when one takes first a berry
and then a bite of maple sugar.</p>

<p>It must have been the river that suggested to them
to write a library of little story-books, the “Bearcamp
Books,” as they called them, one for each rock; and
as the bed of the Bearcamp is all rocks, this was
without doubt the most tremendous literary undertaking
of the century. The stories were carefully
modeled upon the tales of the day, and were written,
like those in Concord, in tiny booklets.</p>

<p>This is the way Ella described their publishing
house to her uncle in the West:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>How do you like being editor? Boy Cousin and I are
publishing books (on a rather smaller scale than you,
though). We make a little blankbook out of writing paper
and then make up a story and write in it. I have written 8
or 9 books, little and big, besides a lot of other stories not in
the book form. I love to write. I wish that when you write
to me you would tell me all about your paper, and about
the printing of it especially, as I never saw any one print.
Boy Cousin can write poetry, but I can’t.</p>
</div>

<p>The first story that Ella contributed to the “Bearcamp
Library” was called “Our Ragbag,” for this
was in the days when people saved their rags and
bought glass dishes with them, and it read as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>As the contents of our ragbag were to be sold, the rags
were laid on a table in an unused room. Well, this is pleasant,
to be in the light once more after being in this dark bag
so many long weeks. “What shall we do” said a piece of
cloth. “Let us each tell our story” said a piece of brocade,
“I will begin—In a beautiful garden in the far off east, a
no less beautiful girl used to walk—sometimes alone—but
more frequently accompanied by her—enough of this
stuff” said a white cotton rag “Let me tell a story, Once
there grew in the south, a beautiful flower known as the cotton
plant. I was that beautiful flower. Nonsense, just as
though we would believe that story, said a little piece of
blue &amp; white muslin “let me tell mine Once there was a
very rich lady came in her carriage to the shop where I was

made into a splendid dress for one of—“Well, I say for

story.”</p>

<span class="fs80">RAINY DAYS AND SUNDAYS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Every day was full, but rainy days were fullest of all.
Those were the times when the children made fiddles
of cornstalks, popguns of elder, and candles of bayberry
wax, using elder stems for moulds; the times
when they played in the big unfinished garret where
two or three barrels of beautifully lumpy maple sugar
always stood. Boy Cousin’s mother had a loom and
kept up the old custom of weaving one piece every
year. The threads of the warp were all drawn into the
harness and the piece was well begun when Ella came,
and she thought it would be the easiest thing in the
world to give the shuttle the skillful little push that
sent it sliding across the threads. “Please mayn’t I
try it only once?” she begged. “I’m almost sure I
could make it go through just as you do”; and finally
Boy Cousin’s good-natured mother let her try it. The
shuttle must have been bewitched, for although Ella
was certain that she started it in exactly the same way
that it had been trained to go, it was willing to go
anywhere and everywhere rather than to the one
proper place. It fell down on the floor and slid away
back under the loom.</p>

<p>But if Ella could not weave, she could fill quills.
These quills were short pieces of the hollow elder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
stem with the pith pushed out. The thread of the
woof was wound on them and they were slipped into
the shuttle. To wind these, the “quilling wheel” was
used. It was much like a spinning wheel, only smaller.
The children took turns in using it, making believe
that they were waging war with the fairy king of the
elder bushes, and that the spools were prisoners whom
they had taken and were binding with chains.</p>

<p>Rainy days were good times to try whatever new
ways they had learned of “taking it off” in cat’s-cradle,
good times to braid bulrushes. They learned
how to make three-strand and seven-strand and how
to sew the braid together and make quite respectable
hats.</p>

<p>Painting was always in order. They manufactured
a very good red paint from the juice of the elderberry;
and when they wanted purple, they added a little soft
soap. For other colors there was Ella’s paint-box to
depend upon; for long before this she had had a new
box to take the place of the one buried among the
roses.</p>

<p>They made various games, but this was not without
its difficulties. Cardboard was at least ten miles
away; birch bark would curl up; but no lack of materials
was ever allowed to interfere with their plans,
there was always something else that would answer
the purpose. In this case they pasted several thicknesses
of newspaper together, deceived the world by
adding a facing of light brown wrapping paper when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
the white gave out; put the cards under flatirons to
make as sure as possible that they would dry without
wrinkles; and when they were dry, painted them with
whatever the games required of words or pictures. It
must be admitted that when these cards were shuffled,
they were a little like the croquet balls in that no
one ever knew which way they would go, and Boy
Cousin’s father suggested that they be dealt with a
snowshovel; but the children looked upon them as
a great success.</p>

<p>If there was ever a minute when they had nothing
else to do, the yellow-covered Farmer’s Almanac was
ready to keep them busy. Here were the riddles and
conundrums and charades and enigmas of the preceding
year, and a new collection for them to puzzle over,
whose answers would not be revealed until the following
year. There were bits of poetry and wise sayings
of famous men. Here was occupation enough for
many rainy days. Ella felt a little envy of Boy Cousin
because he had the Almanac the first of January and
she did not see it until July or August. Queerly
enough, it was so associated in her mind with rainy
days in the New Hampshire garret that she never
thought of looking for a copy anywhere else.</p>

<p>Sometimes the rain fell heavily all day, and even
more heavily up in the mountains at the source of the
river. This meant that the water would roll down
faster and faster. The big meadow was only a little
above the river’s level, and before the afternoon was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
half gone, it would be a wide-spreading sea. Higher
and higher the water rose under the bridge. Not a
rock was to be seen. The whole meadow and the bed
of the river was full of a torrent of black water,
foaming and bubbling.</p>

<p>After one of these rainy days, the children went out
to see what harm had been done, and they found that
Beauty Bay was gone, that even the water had been
washed away, and the Bay had become a part of the
river. The fish that had dwelt in such comfort in the
Bay would now have to make their own living as best
they could, for they had been swept into the river,
into the pond, perhaps all the way to the briny ocean,
and what would a fresh-water fish do then, poor
thing?</p>

<p>In the midst of all the happy occupations of weekdays
came Sunday with a dull thud. Everything
stopped, everything was different. No more tramping
shoes and runabout dresses; people must wear their
best clothes to meeting. The little white meetinghouse
was several miles away, and the two extra passengers
made extra weight; they must drive slowly.
No one could count upon the exact minute of arrival,
and sometimes there were what seemed to Ella whole
hours of waiting before they went into the church.</p>

<p>The Sunday after the flood they started earlier
than usual, for the roads might have been washed by
the rain. They proved to be in good condition, and
the time of waiting was longer than ever. This was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
very pleasant for the older folk. They met their
friends and had nice little chats with them; but it
happened that most of the children lived quite a long
distance from Ella’s grandfather’s, and she did not
know them. There was an attractive little road that
rambled away from one side of the church, and she
wished that she might ramble with it. Over the hill
there would surely be a brook. Cardinal flowers grew
beside brooks. It was not their season, but there
might be just one. Any way, there would certainly be
some kind of wild flowers. But the minister was
coming and they must go into church.</p>

<p>After the service came the Sunday school, and then
people went out into the little graveyard and ate the
lunch that they had brought with them. When Ella
first saw this, she was a little surprised to see people
treat a graveyard in so familiar and friendly a fashion.
Then she remembered a strange story that she had
once read about a little girl who had been carried to
fairyland. She was allowed to see her old friends once
every year, provided not one of them forgot to come
to the place of meeting.</p>

<p>Ella wondered if the people who lay in this graveyard
were pleased to have them come and eat lunch
there. If they were, she was very glad to help make
them happy. The afternoon sermon did not seem
nearly so long as that of the morning, and she went
home thinking that if the people under the stones
really liked to see her, she should like to come again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
She even hoped it would not be so rainy the next Sunday
that she would have to disappoint them.</p>

<p>Sunday was divided into three parts. It was very
much Sunday until they were at home from meeting.
Then it was allowable to put on a dress that was not a
really best one, but was a little better than one for
everyday. Dinner was at about four o’clock. After
this came the third part of the day. It was not proper
to play games, but one might pop corn. One might go
to walk, not on a real tramp through the woods, but
quietly up or down the road.</p>

<p>Ella was never quite sure that she understood all
the Sunday distinctions. For instance, one might
pick berries in the garden, but it would never have
done to take a pail and go to pick them in the fields.
If you were walking on the road and came to a bush
full of them, you might fold up a big leaf or make a
birch-bark basket—a very simple one, of course—and
fill it to carry home. Even then, however, it was
better to explain that the sky looked like rain and the
berries would have been spoiled and so wasted before
morning if left on the bush.</p>

<p>After dinner on the Sunday after the flood, Ella and
Boy Cousin went sedately up the road for a little
walk. They came to a tree of early apples, which
proved to be as sour as apples could possibly be.</p>

<p>“That tree ought to be grafted,” said Boy Cousin.</p>

<p>“How do you graft?” Ella asked.</p>

<p>“You stick into the sour tree some twigs from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
good tree and put wax around them to keep them
dry,” replied Boy Cousin.</p>

<p>“Let’s stick one into this tree.”</p>

<p>“Why isn’t that work just as much as ploughing
would be?” Boy Cousin queried.</p>

<p>“Trees grow Sunday just as much as on other days,
and if we graft them so they can raise good apples instead
of poor, we are not working; we are only helping
them to do their own work well. We haven’t any wax,
but why can’t we get some spruce gum? That would
keep the water out.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t a good apple tree anywhere near.”</p>

<p>“Put in a raspberry twig then,” suggested Ella.
“A raspberry as big as an apple would be good, I
know.”</p>

<p>So they began, and before they were done, not only
raspberry, but also maple, spruce, woodbine, wild
cherry, and even hardhack had been grafted into
that long-suffering tree.</p>

<p>Monday morning Boy Cousin, his father, and Ella
were going part way up one of the mountains to visit a
pasture. In the spring, as soon as the grass was green,
it was the custom to drive cattle and young colts up to
a mountain pasture, where they could feed till autumn.
Every few weeks the owner paid a visit to the
pasture to make sure that his “creatures” were safe
and to give them salt.</p>

<p>They started when the mists were rolling away
from the valleys, and the sun was just peering over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
Ossipee. It was a beautiful ride through the cool
fresh woods, showing here and there a spray of scarlet
leaves. Occasionally they had a glimpse of a rabbit or
a woodchuck, and once a deer watched them for a
moment, then bounded gracefully across the road and
disappeared in the woods.</p>

<p>At the foot of the mountain the little company
started up the narrow footpath, at first smooth, then
stony, as they came to places where the rain had
washed the soil. Most of the way was through the
woods, but here and there were openings where they
could get views of the mountains around them. From
one of these openings they could see the old homestead
half hidden by its great maples.</p>

<p>At last they came to a large pasture surrounded by
woods. Boy Cousin’s father laid some salt on a big
flat rock, and then called, “Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!” For a
minute all was still, then a crash of broken limbs was
heard far off in the woods. Then two or three cattle
plunged headlong out of the forest. Then came others,
and then four little colts. They knew that the visit
meant salt, and every one started for the flat rock.
But every one stopped short, and stood as still as a
statue and gazed at Ella. It was almost embarrassing,
for when she walked to one side, they all walked after
her and gazed more curiously than ever. They had
seen men before, but how a little girl could come into
their pasture, and what a little girl might be, was a
wonder. The shy little colts were so devoured with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
curiosity that they stood still and stared when Ella
ventured to slip up and pat their silky heads. Then
they went to the salt; and after they had eaten what
they wanted, they wandered back, one by one, into
the forest, and Boy Cousin’s father and the children
set out for home.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” called Boy Cousin, as Ella climbed
out over the high wheel. “We’ll go and see how our
grafts are the first thing in the morning.”</p>

<p>But when Ella opened the door, there stood the
mother before the trunk, folding up their clothes and
laying them in. The mail had brought a letter that
made it necessary for them to return to the city in the
morning. There was no time to visit the tree; and
this is why no one knows what happens when a raspberry
twig is grafted into a sour apple tree on Sunday
afternoon.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br>
<span class="fs80">BOOKS AND PLAY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The mother had agreed to take charge of a private
school in the city for a year; and before many days
had passed, Ella was setting out every morning at
eight o’clock to practice an hour before school opened.
It was a pleasant walk down the broad street. It had
been a street of homes with flower gardens and trees
and wide front steps, and porches that looked as if
people liked to sit in them summer evenings and talk
and have good times together. The gardens were full
of old-fashioned flowers that bloomed as if they were
having the best time of their lives. Between them and
the sidewalk were fences so low and open that they invited
passers-by to stop and see the roses, geraniums,
hollyhocks, ladies’-delights, or none-so-pretties, sweet
Mary, sweet William, and the rest of them.</p>

<p>The street was just beginning to think of becoming
a business street, and here and there, wherever there
chanced to be a spare nook or corner, there stood a
tiny store which seemed to look up a little shyly to its
more stately neighbors.</p>

<p>Two of these little stores were of special interest to
Ella. One had a stock of roots and herbs, and among
them were the cinnamon buds that she was still fond
of. Her first spare penny went into the hands of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
clerk in this store, a solemn-looking man with a pasty
white face. Evidently he felt it his duty to give this
reckless small child a lecture, for, still holding the
penny in his hand, he told her how dangerous it was
to eat spices.</p>

<p>“I once knew a man who ate a pound of spice and
died,” he said gloomily.</p>

<p>“How much are these a pound?” Ella asked.</p>

<p>“Forty cents,” the clerk replied.</p>

<p>“Then,” said Ella, “if I buy a cent’s worth each
time, I shouldn’t have had a pound till I had been
here thirty-nine times more, should I?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the clerk wonderingly.</p>

<p>“I’ll be careful,” said Ella blithely. “I’ll keep
count, and when I get to thirty-nine, I’ll stop—and
then pretty soon I’ll begin over. Will you please give
me the first pennyworth now?”—and he did.</p>

<p>The other store held a supply of handkerchiefs,
neckties, suspenders, stockings, and whatever other
small wares men might want to buy. It was presided
over by a trim little old gentleman with the whitest of
linen and the reddest of cheeks. He was sometimes
standing in the doorway when she went by, and one
morning he held a letter in his hand. Ella would have
offered to take it, but she was too shy. Perhaps the
little old gentleman was a bit shy, also, for he hesitated
until she was almost past.</p>

<p>Then he said, “Should you be willing to leave this
in the post-office as you go by?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“I’d like to ever so much,” replied Ella cordially;
and ever after that, when she passed the store and the
little gentleman was in sight, they exchanged smiles
and good-mornings.</p>

<p>“I hope you were very careful of the letter,” said
the mother when she heard the story.</p>

<p>“Barnum’s elephants couldn’t have pulled it
away from me,” Ella declared stoutly. She had just
been to Barnum’s circus, so of course she knew that
whereof she spoke.</p>

<p>This was a school for “Young Ladies.” Ella did so
wish that there was just one little girl among the pupils.
However, she was used to being with older girls,
and she was soon quite at home among these. Her
studies were arithmetic, which she liked, and French
and music, which she did not like.</p>

<p>“Why do you like arithmetic best?” the mother
once asked.</p>

<p>“Because,” replied Ella thoughtfully, “when it’s
done, it’s done, and I know it’s done, and it can’t
come undone. In music, even if I have practiced my
very best, I may strike some wrong note and spoil it
all; and in French, I may forget just one word for
just one minute, and then the whole sentence isn’t
good for anything at all. Arithmetic is easy. It’s just
add, subtract, multiply, and divide; and then you
know it all. The rest is only different ways of using
these things. A baby ought to know how to learn
four things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>These were what Ella called her real “studies”; but
there were two others that she called her “make-believe
studies.” These latter she had chosen herself
according to the color of the covers of the textbook
and the size of the print. The tiny geography was
yellow, with coarse print, and easy questions. The
little grammar had a bright pink cover. It was not
much larger than her own hand, and it was so clear
and easy that Ella felt almost as if she had written it
herself. Who could help understanding when an illustration
was “George had four sweet apples,” or “William’s
dog has come home”? Of course, like all productions
of grown-ups, it had occasional lapses, such
as, “The gay summer droops into pallid autumn,”
which of course no child ought to be expected to
understand.</p>

<p>These two books were so winning that Ella took
great pleasure in saying every day or two, “I have
learned my geography lesson,” or “I have finished
my grammar. May I recite it now?” There was
another reason, which she did not realize, but which
was a strong one. She knew that little girls in the
public schools did not study French and did study
geography and grammar; and she was beginning to
want to do things just like other girls.</p>

<p>Ella had one great advantage over most little girls,
and this was in her mother’s belief that if a child
wanted to do what older people were doing, she ought
to have a chance to try. “She will learn something,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
the busy mother always said, “and whatever she
learns will come in play some time.” That was why,
when the mother and her friend were making wax
flowers, Ella was encouraged to see what she could do.
She had really acquired considerable skill. These ornaments
were as fashionable as ever, and the other
“young ladies” were so glad to follow her instructions
that she began to feel quite like an assistant
teacher.</p>

<p>She used her skill in making a bouquet for her
special little girl friend at the old home, the one who
had sent her the “jockey cap” at Christmas. Such a
bouquet as it was! Ella wrote in her diary, “There
were in it one Moss-rose bud a spiderworth a jonquil,
some lily’s of the valley and a bunch of coral Honeysuckle
two Prickly pears some forgetmenots a bunch
of Verbena’s and two Orange-blossoms with two Hawthorn’s
and some grass with two Sweet peas were the
contents of my bouquet.” It is little wonder that they
did not dwell together in unity and that some of them
were broken when the time of unpacking arrived.</p>

<p>Ella also gave reading lessons. The mother had become
interested in her washerwoman, a negress who
had once been a slave. The woman was eager to learn,
and Ella used to stop three times a week on her way
home from school to hear her read and, incidentally,
to study the little granddaughter and wonder if there
was not some way to make her hair straight and her
face white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>Ella was usually a very happy little girl, but one
day, in pessimistic mood she wrote in her little diary,
in as large letters as the narrow space between the
lines would permit, “I wish I did not have to do anything
but read and play all day long”; but certainly
she did a rather large amount of both reading and
playing.</p>

<p>As to the reading, there was the library of many
volumes at home. There was the Sunday school collection;
and its records of one rainy Sunday declare
that by some method of persuasion she wheedled the
young librarian into allowing her to carry home four
books for the afternoon’s consumption. Then, too, in
the same building as the school there was a large
library, open to the public on payment of one dollar
a year, and from this, she might carry home a book
every day if she chose. No one interfered with her
taking whatever she wished, and she usually wandered
about among the bookcases and selected for
herself. One day, however, the kindly old librarian
heard a child’s voice asking,</p>

<p>“Will you please help me to get a book? I can’t find
what I want.”</p>

<p>He peered over the top of his tall desk, and there
stood a little girl in short skirts and a blue flannel
blouse with brass buttons, looking up at him
expectantly.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” he replied, smiling down upon her.
“How should you like one of the Rollo books?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve read them all, most of them twice, and some
of them three times.”</p>

<p>“What kind of book should you like?”</p>

<p>“I’d like a book about the Spanish Inquisition,”
she declared serenely.</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed the good man. “That’s not
the kind of book for a little girl to read. What made
you think of that?”</p>

<p>“I read ‘The Pit and the Pendulum,’ and it said
the story happened in the Spanish Inquisition. I want
to know what it is and I want to read some more
stories about it.”</p>

<p>The gray-haired librarian was aghast, but by no
means unwise. He brought her a book about the Inquisition,
a big book, a heavy book, a dismal book, in
the finest of print and with two columns to the page.
No sensible child would dream of reading such a book,
and the shrewd old librarian knew it.</p>

<p>One of the constant readers in this library was an
old friend of the librarian, a quaint little gentleman
who wore long hair curling at the ends, knee breeches,
and shoes with big buckles. The librarian must have
told him of the little girl’s request, for when she came
again, he talked with her about the books that she had
read and advised her to read Plutarch’s “Lives.”
He was not so canny as the librarian, for this book,
too, was in fine print and pages of two columns, and
the little girl never read it until she had become a big
girl. And, alas, she never read the scholarly essay on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
the cacao tree which the learned Doctor in Concord
had given her. She always felt guilty about this latter
piece of neglect, and when—not through her fault—the
pamphlet was lost, she was uneasily glad.</p>

<p>The mother was sometimes a little troubled because
Ella did not like to read history.</p>

<p>“It is too hard for me,” objected the little girl.</p>

<p>“But in that little history of yours, the words are
not nearly so long as in ‘Robinson Crusoe,’ and you
do not think that is hard,” said the mother.</p>

<p>“No, but long words don’t make reading hard,”
said Ella. “I like to think I’ve read half a line in just
one word. It’s like the dissected map of the United
States; it isn’t any harder to put in Texas than Rhode
Island, and Texas is so big that when I have put it in,
I feel as if I had really done something. Short words
don’t make reading easy and long words don’t make
it hard. I don’t know what it is, but somehow it’s the
way they write it that makes it hard or easy. I’m
going to know how to do it some time, and then
I’ll write some hard books for children that shall be
easy to read.”</p>

<p>Ella was quite given to making lists of the books
that she read, and often for a number of weeks in
succession she read at the rate of a book a day. The
following is one of her lists with her occasional comments:</p>

<p>Somehow, though one can hardly see how, the small
girl contrived to get in a vast amount of play. Her
special friend was a particularly nice boy who lived
next door, indeed, nearer than next door, for the children
persuaded the authorities of the two houses to slip
off a board from the fence between. Beejay, as Ella
called him, went to the public school, which had two
sessions, while the “Private School for Young Ladies”
had only one; so it was a little difficult to bring their
leisure hours together; but they made the most of
every minute.</p>

<p>They played games without end, croquet, authors,
the checkered game of life, the smashed-up locomotive—a
locomotive with a bell-topped smokestack,
a big bell, and a little whistle—dissected maps,
and one game that they called “By a Lady,” since
that legend alone was printed on the box. They made
a very creditable ghost with the help of chalk and
phosphorus, and were jubilant when a kindly older
sister pretended to be badly scared by its horrors.</p>

<p>Once upon a time they saved up their pennies till
they had enough to buy a cocoanut; and such a cocoanut!
It was the largest they had ever seen and cost
no more than a small one! It was not shaped quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
like the cocoanuts that they had bought before, but
the dealer told them to cut off the outside husk, and
they would have a fine large nut within.</p>

<p>No woman was ever so pleased with a bargaincounter
purchase. They hurried down cellar and
Beejay attacked the nut first with a knife, then with
a hatchet. The mischievous thing rolled away from
the blows into corner after corner as if it was bewitched.
Ella had just been learning the “Song of
the Brook,” and she quoted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container fs90">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Among my skimming swallows’—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Say, Beejay, do you suppose we shall ever have any
‘swallows’? I should so like just one—of cocoanut
milk.” Beejay attacked the puzzle more savagely
than ever. The outer husk came off, and there lay the
tiniest cocoanut that they had ever seen. It was no
bigger than a child’s fist. Such was their great bargain.
Such are the deceits of the world and the sellers
of cocoanuts.</p>

<p>“Sold!” said Beejay; “but let’s never, never tell.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, we won’t,” declared Ella. “Cross my
heart. We won’t have them all laughing at us.
Mother said once cocoanuts were not good for me.
Do you think one that size would make me very, very
sick? Let’s eat it just as fast as we can and put the
shell into the furnace, and no one will ever know.” No
one ever did know, for the secret was faithfully kept.</p>

<p>There was no end to the things the playmates did.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
They discovered a place where clay could be found,
an agreeable variety of clay, not so hard as the claystones
of the Bearcamp River, and not so soft as to
be sticky, but just right to cut into silk winders,
hearts and rounds, and boys and girls, like those that
came out of cookie pans, and dozens of other things.
They followed the directions of “The Boy’s Own
Book” and made a boomerang that would not make
the return trip; a battledore that was continually
coming to pieces; a shuttlecock that never would go
straight up, but always off to the farthest corner of
the room. They pored over the minerals that the
learned Doctor had given to Ella, and they had eager
searches for fossils in a non-fossiliferous country.</p>

<p>“The Boy’s Own Book” declared that glass would
melt and that asbestus would not, although it looked
like glass. A big brother told them of a ledge just outside
of the city where they could find asbestus. They
packed some lunch into a little willow basket—the
one that Ella always filled with firecrackers and pinwheels
a week before the Fourth of July, trying hard
and with a vast expenditure of mental arithmetic to
get as much noise and sparkle for her money as possible—and
off they went to the ledge. They found
the asbestus and brought some home and put it into
the kitchen stove. It did not melt; but neither did
the piece of glass that they laid beside it.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s too thick,” Beejay suggested. “Let’s
take some of the bird of paradise’s tail.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>The bird of paradise was a glass bird with a long tail
of spun glass so bright and shining that it had not been
thrown away when the bird broke into many pieces.
This, too, they tried in the stove and also in the gas,
but it would not melt. The children were disgusted.</p>

<p>“The boomerang wouldn’t boom,” declared Ella;
“the battledore wouldn’t bat; the shuttlecock
wouldn’t go one bit like either a shuttle or a cock; and
now the glass won’t melt. Let’s just go on our own
way and let the book alone. We can think of things
enough to do. Let’s paint some autumn leaves. I’ll
get my water colors and you get your crayons. You
can use one and I’ll use the other, and we’ll see
which will get done first.”</p>

<p>But a voice called, “Ella, I want you to go down
street on an errand.”</p>

<p>It chanced that Beejay’s mother had also an errand
at the same store; so the children went off together,
swinging the little yellow basket between them.</p>

<p>When they came home, they were running breathlessly,
and waving two handbills.</p>

<p>“It’s at two o’clock this afternoon,” cried one.</p>

<p>“And it’s only ten cents, and the man said it was
almost always fifteen in other cities,” cried the other,
“and that it was well worth twenty-five.”</p>

<p>“And it’s very educational, the man said it was.”</p>

<p>The two mothers were easily persuaded to let them
go to the panorama. They came home jubilant.
There were no movies then, but they had seen pictures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
of the city of Venice with a marvelous number of gondolas,
the sinking of the Alabama, the firemen of New
York, Dr. Kane’s vessel that tried to get to the North
Pole, and finally “a beautiful fairy scene,” as Ella
declared.</p>

<p>Surely, there was no need of help from “The Boy’s
Own Book,” for on the way home the children had
planned to manufacture a fleet of gondolas, and also
an Alabama that, by the pulling of a string, would
really sink. All this they would do without fail to-morrow;
but “to-morrow” was another day, and
when it arrived, a little girl with a hot red face, a sore
throat, a headache and a backache was tossing about
in bed. Ella had the measles.</p>

<p>Never did mind cure have a fairer trial. She did
not have a knotted string and repeat over and over,
“Every day in every way I am getting better and
better”; but she began at the very foundation, and
when the red spots appeared, she declared:</p>

<p>“It isn’t measles. I won’t have measles. The hall
was hot and it made my face burn when I was there,
and it just kept on burning”; but the longer she said
it was not measles, the faster the red spots came out.</p>

<p>“It isn’t fair,” she wailed. “It isn’t the least bit
fair that I should have measles when Beejay hasn’t.
We have so many things to do, I can’t be sick.”</p>

<p>But the red spots grew brighter and brighter. It
was only two weeks before the end of the school year,
and Ella had had her last day in the “Private School
for Young Ladies.”</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">There was something that Ella wanted even more
than she had wanted the box of tin soldiers or the ride
in a swan boat, and this was that she might go to the
public school. It was quite the custom for a public
school girl to invite a younger child to go with her for
half a day. If the child behaved well, the teacher
made no objection, and perhaps gave her a book of
pictures to look at. If her notions of order were not
quite up to the mark, the teacher would draw the
little hostess aside and say:</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you’d better bring her again till
she is older. She is rather too young to have to keep
quiet so long.”</p>

<p>Oddly enough, it had happened that Ella had never
visited the public school, and all the glory of something
unknown was about it. Of course she had heard
many school stories from her playmates. She knew
that it was carried on in a businesslike fashion, that
children did not choose their books by the color of the
covers or recite what they pleased and when they
pleased, and go home whenever they liked; but that
lessons had to be learned, and had to be recited when
the time for recitation had come. She knew that once
in a while the superintendent of schools came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
examine the pupils, and that he listened to their answers
as if whether they were right or wrong was really
an important matter. One day, after his kindly examination
of a class in which were several of Ella’s
playmates, they came home at noon in great glee.
After his examination, he had said to the teacher—but
quite loud enough for the whole room to hear,</p>

<p>“The children in your class have done so well that
I am going to ask you if you won’t take them out to
the grove this afternoon for a little picnic.”</p>

<p>They had asked the teacher if Ella might go with
them, but she did not care to be responsible for any
more children and had said no, the picnic was for the
pupils only.</p>

<p>Now Ella was free every afternoon and could have
gone to a picnic six days in the week, if there had been
one to go to; but somehow this was different, and the
tears really came into her eyes that day when she
thought of the whole class having such a good time
from which she herself was shut out. Some of these
same little picnickers envied her for coming home at
one o’clock or even earlier; but nothing would have
induced them to express such a thought. The city
was very proud of her public schools. There was a
general feeling that the work of private schools was
not so good; and these little girls held their heads
very high because they were parts of the great public
school system.</p>

<p>There were many other times when Ella felt a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
shut out of things. She played with the other children
and went to their simple parties. They came to see
her Saturday afternoons and she went to see them;
but they were always speaking of little events in
school that she knew nothing about. She did so wish
that she could speak in such familiar fashion about
the delight of “getting up head” and the mortification
of losing a place in the class because a word was left
out in a recitation. In Ella’s class of one, there was
no head and no foot; and when the other children
talked of such things, she felt dull and stupid and out
of the magic circle.</p>

<p>Everything about their schools was different. At
recess, Ella slipped into the big library and read a
story. They marched out into the yard for a blissful
quarter of an hour of play. She thought it would be
delightful to march out in line with her hands down at
her sides, one little girl before her and another behind
her. In short, Ella wanted to be “in things.” It
never occurred to her to boast of studying French
and Latin and of reciting with “young ladies” many
years older than she. She wanted to be just like other
little girls, to study just what they studied, and to do
just what they did. She did not know what “conventional”
meant, but that was what she wanted to
be.</p>

<p>Now the time had passed for which the mother had
agreed to take charge of the “Private School for
Young Ladies,” and she, too, was thinking about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
public schools, and wondering a little how the small
daughter, who had gone on her own way as independently
as if she was the only child in the world,
would get on with walking between parallel lines and
being bound to do just what other children were doing.
There was no private school at hand that was at
all promising, and it really was quite a dilemma. One
day she asked Ella how she would like to go to the
public school.</p>

<p>“I’d rather go there than anywhere else in the
whole world, except to Norway or Switzerland,” she
exclaimed. “May I go? May I go really?”</p>

<p>“We’ll think it over,” said the mother; and indeed
it needed to be thought over. Here was a little girl almost
twelve years old. Other children of twelve had
been in school seven years; but this child’s school life
consisted thus far of one year with an hour a day of
arithmetic and French, and the rest of the time spent
out of doors with a big dog for company; of a year and
a half more with the same studies and a few months of
Latin, but with much freedom as to her coming and
going, short sessions, and long play hours.</p>

<p>She had, then, a smattering of French; she had read
“Fables” in Latin; she had learned whatever chanced
to strike her fancy in the yellow geography and the
pink grammar; and she was far beyond her age in
arithmetic. She could sketch fairly well, she could
play on the piano as well as children of her age were
expected to do; she could knit and crochet and do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
almost anything with her hands; she could win the
heart of cat or dog or bird; she could climb a mountain;
and she had read many hundreds of books, ranging
all the way from “Songs for Little Ones at Home”
to a volume of the “Religions of the World,” which
she had discovered in an attic and thought more interesting
than the Sunday school “Question Book.”
She had never been prepared for any school, and how
would she stand with other children who had had
seven years of regulation training? “Suppose that she
was put into a class of children much younger than
herself,” thought the mother. She could not have the
child humiliated and unhappy. What was the best
thing to do?</p>

<p>Ella herself had been troubled all her life about
her own ignorance. When she was only five, she had
begged to go to school because the older children had
assured her that she would grow up to be a dunce—whatever
that might be—if she did not go. Later,
she would have been even more anxious if there had
not been so many books to read and so many interesting
things to do and to think about. Now when the
mother asked, “What should you do if you were put
into a class of little girls much younger than yourself?”
she had her answer all ready, “I’d study and study
and study, till I knew so much they wouldn’t have me
there, and they would have to put me up higher.”</p>

<p>The mother concluded that the little girl would
make her way, and the public school was decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
upon. She saw the principal of the school, and he
said, “Send her down Monday morning, and we will
see where she belongs.”</p>

<p>When Monday morning came, Ella started for
school at the same time with the other girls and
walked down the same street with them. This in itself
was a delight. At last she was within the circle,
and soon she would be able to talk about the mysteries
of school life as easily as they.</p>

<p>She wore a cheery little red dress, a soft gray hat
trimmed with a bit of black velvet and a red quill.
She carried a rather large paper slate. It was made
like a book and contained three sheets of firm stiff
paper slated on both sides. This was the very latest
thing in slates, and she was proud of it. She had one
possession, however, that made her feel even more
elegant than the slate, and that was her new slate
pencil. Common slate pencils were hard and inclined
to scratch. Ella’s was made of wood, soft and agreeable
to the touch, and had “leads” of clay, which
could be pushed up and down by moving a little peg
in a groove, just as if it had been a pencil of solid gold.
Ella dearly loved all things of the nature of tools
or machines, and she had saved her money for many
days to buy this pencil. Surely, such a choice article
as this ought to give one courage.</p>

<p>Cora was the oldest of the little group. There were
six rooms in the school building, and she was in Number
Two, the next to the highest. As they drew near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
to the schoolhouse, Cora began to give the new pupil
some good advice.</p>

<p>“The principal thinks you don’t know anything if
you can’t do examples,” she said, “and he’ll give you
some awfully hard ones. Girls that come here from
private schools don’t know very much, and you’ll
probably be put in the Sixth Room. If you work
hard, you can be promoted, maybe before the end of
the year.”</p>

<p>Ella began to feel so humble that she never thought
of saying, “I can do cube root, and you are only in
denominate numbers,” and they went silently up the
stairs.</p>

<p>“That’s the room,” said Cora. “That’s the principal
sitting at the large desk, and there is the assistant
at the smaller one.”</p>

<p>Ella wished that Cora would go in with her, but the
older girl went off to her own room, and Ella stood on
the threshold, a rather shy but exceedingly expectant
little girl. Fortunately the assistant looked up and
came to her.</p>

<p>“This is Ella, I am sure,” she said. “I know your
mother, and I am glad to have her little daughter in
the school.”</p>

<p>Then she introduced Ella to the principal. The
girls and boys were all afraid of him, and when Ella
looked fearlessly up into his face as if he was an old
friend, and laid her hand in his, he really felt a little
awkward. He was not used to being treated in that
way by children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>“After the opening exercises we will see what you
can do,” he said. He motioned her to a chair just beyond
the farther end of the platform, near that of the
pleasant assistant, and Ella seated herself, so radiantly
happy that she had no dread of even the hard
examples that were to come.</p>

<p>She looked about the room. It had many windows,
and it seemed to her enormously large. Blackboards
ran around the four sides wherever the windows and
doors would permit, and on these blackboards were
maps and examples. Best of all, there were twenty-four
desks—she counted them over and over—and
at each desk sat two girls or two boys, as the case
might be.</p>

<p>None of them paid the least attention to her, for
this was the highest class in the building. They would
go to the high school in the spring, and what did they
care about a small newcomer who might for all they
knew, be condemned to the Sixth Room, or even be
sent to the intermediate school a little way off? They
were only two or three years older than Ella, but two
or three years count for a great length of time when
one is not yet twelve, and she looked at them with a
deference that she had never felt for any grown-up.
Grown-ups belonged to a queer world of their own.
They had different notions and different ways of looking
at things; but these boys and girls, venerable as
they were by age and position, were nevertheless of
her own world, and could be judged by standards that
she could understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>It is to be feared that Ella did not pay very close
attention to the “opening exercises,” but older folk
have sometimes paid no more, even though with much
smaller temptation.</p>

<p>But the assistant was beckoning to her and was
handing her a paper.</p>

<p>“Do these examples,” she said; “or as many of
them as you can,” she added, for she, too, was of
Cora’s opinion in regard to the children who came
from private schools.</p>

<p>The slate pencil that behaved like a gold one and
the little girl who wielded it worked their way rather
scornfully through addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division. Then came fractions, decimals,
compound numbers, interest, and square root; but
now the principal and the assistant called a halt and
held a conference. Ella heard snatches of their rather
emphatic remarks.</p>

<p>“She won’t be twelve for two weeks—altogether
too young for this room.”</p>

<p>“The Third Room would be only play for her.”</p>

<p>“She has studied French and Latin,” said the assistant,
“but she knows very little of geography
and grammar.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” declared the principal decidedly.
“If she can do arithmetic, she can do anything. Put
her into the Second Room.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br>
<span class="fs80">ELLA’S FIRST DAY IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The assistant led the way to the Second Room, and
Ella followed, her heart beating triumphantly, for
this was Cora’s room. She was introduced to the
teacher, and the teacher gave her a seat at one of the
double desks. Ella’s face fell, for no one was sitting
at the other half.</p>

<p>“Ida is away to-day,” said the teacher, “but she
will be here to-morrow, I think. I am sure that you
will like her.”</p>

<p>So her seatmate’s name was Ida! Could anything
have been pleasanter? She made up her mind to write
Ida of New Hampshire that very afternoon. But
there wouldn’t be any afternoon; she would be in
school from two until five. Never mind, there would
be all the more to tell her.</p>

<p>Across the room was Cora, who cast at Ella a look
of surprise but of genuine welcome. The two seats
were diagonally opposite, and when Ella studied
mensuration, a little later, she always thought of the
diagonal of a rectangle as the distance from Cora’s
seat to hers.</p>

<p>“The second class in geography,” the teacher
called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>About half of the pupils in the room left their seats
and took their stand at the back and around two sides
of the room. This was to be Ella’s class, and to-morrow
she would stand with them. To-morrow she
could say, “My class.” Could anything be more delightful?</p>

<p>The girl at the head raised her hand. The teacher
nodded, and the girl said, “I have been at the head
three recitations.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the teacher, “then you may go to
the foot,” and she walked down to the other end of
the class.</p>

<p>Ella thought this was rather unfair and that she
ought to have been rewarded rather than sent to the
foot.</p>

<p>The teacher gave Ella a little yellow book of geographical
questions, and the new pupil followed the
recitation with the keenest interest, for this was the
first time that she had ever seen a class of boys and
girls of her own age.</p>

<p>The teacher nodded to the girl at the head of the
class, and she began to recite:</p>

<p>“There are ten Territories besides the District of
Columbia, which is under the direct control of Congress.”</p>

<p>“I wonder why it is,” thought Ella, “and what
‘under the direct control’ means. Can’t it do anything
without asking Congress? What does a District
ever want to do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>But the next girl was reciting.</p>

<p>“The Territories and their capitals are, Washington,
Olympia, on Puget Sound.” And she went on
through the whole ten more easily and rapidly than
Ella thought she should ever be able to do. But what
did it mean that hands were raised here and there all
down the line?</p>

<p>“Mary,” said the teacher to the girl below the one
who had recited, “what is wrong?”</p>

<p>“She said ‘Salt Lake City, <em>on</em> Great Salt Lake.’ It
should be ‘<em>near</em> Great Salt Lake.’”</p>

<p>“Correct. Take your place,” the teacher said; and
Mary took her place just above the girl who had
failed, while she and all those that had stood between
them moved down one place.</p>

<p>“Frank,” said the teacher, and a boy who stood
next went on:</p>

<p>“The Gulf of Alaska and Kodiak Island are south
of Alaska.”</p>

<p>“The Columbia River separates Washington Territory
from Oregon,” said the next; and the third
recited:</p>

<p>“It may be said of the animals of the Territories
that immense herds of buffalo, deer, and horses roam
over the prairies. Polar bears, wild goats, and sheep
are found in the mountainous regions.”</p>

<p>The little girl who had gone to the foot now waved
her hand excitedly.</p>

<p>“What is it, Alice?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>“He said ‘polar bears’; it should have been ‘grizzly
bears.’”</p>

<p>“Correct.” And Alice left the foot and moved in
triumph down the side, across the end of the room,
and up the other side until she was within four of the
head.</p>

<p>“It’s lovely! It’s just like a game,” thought Ella.
“You have to know things, though, and know the
questions as well as the answers. That’s funny. I
don’t see why the teacher doesn’t ask them.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the teacher did ask questions, a whole
hailstorm of them, and they went all over North
America. Ella was quite aghast when she saw how
promptly they were answered and how few mistakes
there were. These were some of the questions:</p>

<p>“What are the principal capes in North America?
What is the capital of Missouri? What bounds New
Hampshire on the north? What are the principal
manufactures of Connecticut? For what is Delaware
noted? Name the western branches of the Mississippi.
What States produce the most tobacco? What are
the principal exports of British America? Where is
Mazatlan?”</p>

<p>She was still more aghast when the teacher said:</p>

<p>“You did very well with the advance lesson, but
not so well with the general questions. Remember
that you are responsible for whatever you have once
learned.”</p>

<p>This was decidedly different from the comfortable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
fashion of roaming about the tiny yellow geography
to which Ella had been accustomed, learning a few
“map questions” wherever she chose.</p>

<p>The new pupil had heard one recitation and she felt
quite wise in the customs of the school. She did not
yet see why Alice was sent to the foot; but she had
learned that lessons were short, but must be learned
perfectly, and recited without questioning; that
everything must be recited exactly right; that if it
was not, you raised your hand and went above her;
and that you were expected to remember everything
you had ever learned.</p>

<p>Ella tried hard to recall what she had ever learned
that she was absolutely sure of, and the only thing
she could call to mind on the instant was the multiplication
table—which she had never learned!</p>

<p>The geography class was now dismissed, and the
children took their seats. The roll was called for reports,
and when it came to Alice, she reported, “One
hundred, and also fifteen extra for being at the head
three recitations.” Then Ella understood one thing
more. If you could “get up head” and stay there
three recitations, you went to the foot with fifteen
extra and had a chance to get to the head again. The
fifteen extra might be used perhaps to make up for
some failure. She wished she knew. It wouldn’t be
quite so dreadful to fail if there was only some way
to make up. She did not want to ask any of the girls;
she must ask Beejay. Then she remembered that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
Beejay could not be asked, for he had gone away to a
boarding-school for boys. He had been to the public
school, and she wondered why he had never told her
all of these interesting things. He went to another
school, however, and maybe all schools were not so
wonderful as this one. She would write to him and
ask.</p>

<p>Ella’s lessons were usually recited in a few minutes,
but evidently more time was allowed for them in this
school, for the children now took out their atlases and
set to work to draw a map of Maine. Ella watched
eagerly. The teacher noticed how interested she was
and asked if she could draw maps.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied the little girl honestly.
“I never tried; but I can draw flowers and old castles
and dogs and cats.”</p>

<p>“I will lend you an atlas,” said the teacher, “and
you can try.”</p>

<p>The teacher walked about the room, looking at the
children’s work and showing them where they could
make it better. Ella’s hands began to tremble, she
did so hope that hers was as good as the others. The
teacher stood watching her—for half an hour, it
seemed to the little girl. Then she took up the paper
and looked it over carefully.</p>

<p>“That is exceedingly good,” she said as she laid it
down.</p>

<p>Ella was happy. The teacher had not said “exceedingly”
to any other boy or girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>The short winter afternoon was fast coming to an
end. For a few days before Christmas most of the
schools were obliged to let the pupils go home at half-past
four instead of five, unless there was gas in the
building or it was a specially bright, sunny day. It
was almost half-past four now, and the teacher said,
“You may put away your books.” The children
put some of them into their desks, and fastened the
others together in a strap to carry home. Then they
waited for the bell to strike.</p>

<p>Now was coming the event to which Ella had so
looked forward, the marching out in single file with
her arms down at her sides and one girl walking in
front of her and another behind her. But she was disappointed,
for the teacher said,</p>

<p>“Ella, if you will wait a few minutes after school
closes, I will give you the list of the books that you
will need.”</p>

<p>When Ella went for her hat and coat, the children
were all gone, and she had to walk home alone. She
went by way of the bookstore, however, and it almost
made up for her disappointment to be able to hand the
slip of paper to the clerk and say with an air of being
perfectly at ease—she had practiced her speech in a
whisper all the way down the street—</p>

<p>“Will you please give me the books on this list?
They are for the Second Room in the grammar
school.”</p>

<p>The clerk smiled. Evidently he had seen little new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
scholars before, and Ella went home with a written
arithmetic and a mental arithmetic, an atlas and a
little book of geographical questions, a spelling book,
a Fifth Reader, a writing book, a red penholder, an
impishly sharp little steel pen marked Gillott 303,
just like the ones that she had used at the seminary.
It was a heavy load, but the glory of it lessened the
weight. She hurried up the street, eager to tell of her
day’s experiences, and happy to think that, even if
she had not marched out in the line, she was at least,
and at last, within the circle.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br>
<span class="fs80">“FOOSLE” REMAINS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">In the morning, when Ella reached the head of the
stairs on the second floor, there stood the principal.
The little girl looked up at him in a friendly fashion
and he said “Good morning,” and added, rather to
his surprise, for he seldom talked with the children,</p>

<p>“Do you like our school?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do! I do!” she exclaimed with enthusiasm.
“I think it is just splendid.”</p>

<p>At the other side of Ella’s desk sat a little girl in a
blue dress with a dainty white apron trimmed with
narrow edging. This was Ida. The teacher introduced
the two children. Ida said,</p>

<p>“Haven’t you been in the public school before?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Ella.</p>

<p>“Did you go to a private school?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Ella replied rather unwillingly, for suddenly,
in view of the businesslike ways of the public
school, all that she had done before began to seem very
childish. “Before that, I went to a seminary.”</p>

<p>“Did you really? I should think that would be
splendid. I knew a girl once who went to a seminary,
but she was old, as much as sixteen. Are you going to
be in the Second Class?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. I was here yesterday, and I heard the geography
class.”</p>

<p>“After the opening exercises,” said Ida, “the First
Class recites in arithmetic, and then ours comes. I’ll
show you where the lesson is, and you’ll have time to
do the examples before we recite. But you haven’t
covered your books yet!”</p>

<p>Ella looked at Ida’s books and saw that every one
was neatly covered with light brown paper; and again
she felt out of the circle.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you how at recess,” said Ida; and Ella
was comforted, for in an hour and a half she would be
“in” and like other girls. She noticed that Ida’s name
was neatly written on the outside of her light brown
covers, and that she had the prettiest capital <em>I</em> that
Ella had ever seen. It began like all I’s, then at the
line the pen moved away to the left in a handsome
little horizontal loop that made quite a different thing
of the letter from the common everyday I’s of other
people. Ella determined to work till she could make
one as good. She wished her name began with an <em>I</em>!
Evidently her earthquake handwriting would not do
for schoolbooks. Beejay’s older brother wrote beautifully;
she would ask him to write on her books, and
she would tell him about that handsome letter.</p>

<p>The lesson in arithmetic consisted of ten examples
in simple interest. Ella finished these in a little while,
and supposed there was nothing more to be done; but
when the class was called, she found that the scholars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
were sent to put their work on the blackboard, and
were then to explain it in exactly the way given in the
book. She had done the examples in a way that was
easier, but was different; and she was out of it again.
Oh, if she only could be just like other girls, she wailed
mentally.</p>

<p>So the morning went on. Ella was first “in,” then
“out” again. The lesson in mental arithmetic was
very easy, she thought, as she read the questions, but
she never dreamed of learning them by heart. The
teacher told the class to close their books, and then
she read,</p>

<p>“Bought a piano for $300, and ⅖ of the cost of the
instrument was <span class="xs"><sup>4</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span> of what I received of nine young
ladies for its use one year; how much did each young
lady pay for its use?”</p>

<p>Ella was greatly taken aback. She could not recite
the question with her book closed; and even if she
had learned this one, could she learn such nonsense as
the one that stood next to it, “¾ of ⅔ of 70 are
<span class="xs"><sup>5</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span> of 4 times what number?” She was afraid not,
and for the first time she began to wonder if a school of
boys and girls would really be so much pleasanter than
a school of young ladies. She felt hopelessly disgraced
when she had to say to the teacher, “I don’t know.”</p>

<p>There was one more recitation before the school
closed at noon, and that was grammar. The little
store had been out of grammars, and therefore Ella
had not been able to learn the lesson. The teacher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
had told her that she might ask Ida anything that she
wanted to know. The first thing she asked was why
Ida’s grammar was pencil-marked with straight lines
beside some of the paragraphs and not the rest.</p>

<p>“Why, those marked are what we learn,” Ida replied.</p>

<p>“What are the others about?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. No one ever reads those.”</p>

<p>Ella’s little pink grammar at home began,</p>

<p>“Do all nations use the same language?” and the
answer was,</p>

<p>“They do not.”</p>

<p>This was easy and sensible, and about things that
even very little girls could understand, but this new
grammar began,</p>

<p>“English grammar treats of the principles and
usages of the English Language,” and went on to say
that grammar was divided into four parts, “Orthography,
Etymology, Syntax, and Prosody.” Her grammar
at home declared that</p>

<div class="poetry-container fs90">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A noun’s the name of anything,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">As <em>school</em>, or <em>garden</em>, <em>hoop</em>, or <em>swing</em>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The new grammar remarked that “Letters cannot be
too carefully distinguished from elementary sounds.”
Ella wondered why. She had known letters ever since
she could remember, and she had never confused
them with elementary sounds—whatever elementary
sounds might be. How could things be so important
when they were not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>The class took their places around the room. Somehow
there seemed to be more of them than when they
were seated. Ella remembered days when she did not
have to recite her French lesson because the young
lady who was for a little while the rest of the class had
failed to come. With all these boys and girls in the
class, there would plainly be no such good fortune.
There would be no hurrying to learn her lessons and
then being excused to go home early, for classes came
at just such times, and Ida had told her that if a pupil
stayed away, or was excused, she would be marked
zero for the lesson.</p>

<p>Ella sat and listened while the class recited. She
grew more and more discouraged with every recitation.
Not one girl or boy asked a question as to the
meaning of these queer statements. Ella supposed
that was because they understood it all—and she
did not. How could she ever go on with them? She
was almost sorry that she had ever come to a public
school. She was a plucky little girl, however, and
when she went home at noon, she set to work bravely
to learn her spelling lesson, and never a word did
she say about the inferiority of public schools to
private.</p>

<p>Ida had told her that in the intermediate school the
children had to learn the words of the spelling lesson
in order and “put them out” to themselves, but that
this was not done in the grammar school, and Ella
was quite at ease about this lesson, for she could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
see how there could be anything “queer and cranky”
in a recitation in spelling. There was not, and at the
end of the lesson the teacher called the names for reports.
Ella had often written in her little diary, when
she could not think of anything else to say, “Had a
perfect lesson, didn’t fail,” or “Didn’t have a very
good lesson and the teacher was cross”; but to have
her name called and have her report recorded in definite
figures in the big book that lay on the table—that
was quite a different matter. She answered
shyly but happily, “One hundred.”</p>

<p>After the spelling came twenty minutes of writing;
and now the little newcomer was in despair, for she
knew just how poor her handwriting was. She knew
that no two letters were of the same height or slanted
the same way. She knew that it made her hand ache
to write half a page, and she knew that the writing
was hardly the least bit better since the seminary
days. She opened the new copybook at the first page,
and behold there was the old familiar sentence,
“Honesty is the best policy,” printed in the fashionable
“Spencerian hand” with all its rounded flourishes.
She had long ago tried her best to copy this
very sentence and had failed. What would the
teacher say? Perhaps the principal would even put
her back into a lower room.</p>

<p>The watchful teacher saw that something was going
wrong, and when she looked at the line or two that
the little girl had written, she knew what it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>“Writing is a little hard for you, isn’t it,” she said,
“just as arithmetic is hard for Alice?” The teacher
was ahead of her times, and as she looked at the
cramped little letters, she added:</p>

<p>“Did you ever guess that you were making your
fingers work too hard, while there was a good strong
muscle here”—and she touched Ella’s forearm—“that
would be glad to help them? Just let the muscle
lie on the table in this way and try to make some
curves like these,” and she gave her a slip of paper
with a whole line of curves and loops. “Hold the pen
so,” she continued, “but don’t hold it too tight. No
one will try to take it away from you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see! I see!” exclaimed Ella. “If that muscle
is right and not rolled over on its side, the pen <em>has</em>
to be right; it <em>can’t</em> point the wrong way if it tries”;
and she went to work on the impossible writing with
fresh courage, for now she had a definite idea of what
she was to do.</p>

<p>The spelling and writing lasted from two until a
quarter of three. Then came the geography and the
reading.</p>

<p>The geography lesson was a review of questions on
the Central and Pacific States. Ella had been over
and over these questions till she was sure that she
could answer every one of them. She stood at the
foot of the class of course as the newest arrival, and
she never dreamed of going up any higher; but a boy
who stood three above her recited:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>“Iron and lead are found in Indiana, and the richest
mines in the world are found in Michigan.”</p>

<p>Not one pupil raised a hand. Those below the boy
did not know that there was anything wrong, and
those near the head had nothing to gain and were not
watching so closely as they would have done if there
had been a chance to move up. Very timidly Ella put
up her hand.</p>

<p>“What is it, Ella?” asked the teacher.</p>

<p>“He should have said, ‘the richest <em>copper</em> mines in
the world,’” she answered in a voice that trembled a
little, for they were all looking at her.</p>

<p>“That is right,” said the teacher. “Take your
place,” and she moved up three places. She was so
happy that she could hardly stand still. What a story
she would have to tell the mother and to write to Boy
Cousin, of going up three places the very first day!</p>

<p>But even greater glory awaited her. The next pupil
recited:</p>

<p>“Kentucky is noted for foosle remains of animals
and for its mammoth cave.”</p>

<p>“What kind of remains?” asked the teacher, and
the boy replied,</p>

<p>“Foosle.”</p>

<p>“The whole class may tell what that word is,” said
the teacher, and there was a chorus of “Fossil.”</p>

<p>“Can any one tell what a fossil is?”</p>

<p>No one but Ella raised a hand. Her cheeks were
still burning, but she answered bravely:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>“A fossil is what used to be a plant or an animal.
It has turned into stone, and is dug up out of the
ground.”</p>

<p>“Excellent,” said the teacher. “It sounds as if
you really knew fossils. Have you any of your own
that you could bring to school to show us?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ella, remembering the Doctor’s generous
package of specimens. “I have some that were
given me and two that I found.”</p>

<p>It was too dark for the reading lesson. The school
was dismissed, and Ella went home, her eyes sparkling
and her cheeks all aglow. She loved the public
school.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE TORIES’ ALPHABET</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Ella kept a diary because her mother wanted her to.
It was not always easy for her to think of something
to write in it, but now she had a new subject, “Getting
up head.” If she planned carefully, she could
make this subject serve her need for three days. For
the first day she wrote, “I got up to the head of the
class. After I have been there three recitations, I go
to the foot and have fifteen extras.” For the second
day she wrote, “I hope I can stay at the head of the
class three recitations and then go to the foot and
have fifteen extras.” For the third day she wrote, “I
stayed at the head three recitations, then went to the
foot to-day and now have fifteen extras.” It is small
wonder that she awoke one morning saying over to
herself:</p>

<table class="autotable fs90" style="width: 75%">
<tr>
<td class="tdly">“I get up head</td>
<td class="tdly">We get up head</td>

<tr>

<td class="tdly">You get up head</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdly">&nbsp; He gets up head</td>
<td class="tdly">They get up head”</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>After two or three weeks, there was much talk
about reports. The first one was coming at the end of
her first month in the school, and Ella’s heart sank
whenever she thought about it. She had been at the
head a number of times, and thought she had had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
more than enough extras to balance her few failures.
Still, she had a feeling that something might come
that would give her a low rank or might even put her
into a lower room.</p>

<p>The reports were to be given out on Friday. Thursday
the principal came to the door and asked the
teacher to send Ella to the office. Ella turned pale
and her hands were cold. She had heard of severe
scoldings and even worse that had taken place in that
office. She did not know of anything that she had
done, but there might be something. She wished she
was back in the private school. Her fingers trembled
as she knocked at the door.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said the voice of the principal, and she
went in.</p>

<p>He said, “There is a matter about which I wish to
speak to you, and perhaps it will not be necessary
to see your mother.”</p>

<p>This was worse and worse.</p>

<p>“What could she have done,” thought the frightened
little girl.</p>

<p>The principal went on:</p>

<p>“I have been looking over the reports of your room,
and I find that yours is rather different from what I
expected.” He paused a long moment. Then he went
on: “You have done remarkably well, better than I
thought you could possibly do in a new school with
new studies and new ways. When you go home this
noon, you may tell your mother what I have said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
And there is one thing more. Do you think you can
keep this a secret, and not say a word to any one but
your mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I will,” Ella declared with emphasis.</p>

<p>It would have been simpler to send a note, but
this principal liked to try experiments, and he did
not always realize the sensitiveness of children. He
thought it would be interesting to see of what kind
of stuff this little girl was made, and whether the
interview would be agreeable to her hardly entered
his mind.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” he said, “and tell your mother you
are doing finely.”</p>

<p>The mother thought Ella was too young to skip a
class, so she was not promoted.</p>

<p>A week later, Ella met the principal in the hall,
and he asked, “Did you tell any one besides your
mother?”</p>

<p>He was pleased with the touch of indignation with
which she replied, without deigning to say “No,” “I
promised I wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>Ella soon forgot the unpleasant part of this interview,
and had a comfortable feeling that she and the
principal had a secret together. When the other
children blamed him, she always stood by him, and
she was never afraid of him again.</p>

<p>She was radiantly happy when the reports were
given out, for hers read, “Scholarship, 91%, Rank in
class, 3. Deportment, Excellent.” Below this, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
space for remarks, the teacher had written, “Ella is
studious and well behaved.” This pleased Ella very
much.</p>

<p>“You see,” she said to her mother, “she had to
write percentage and rank, but she did not have to
say anything in the ‘Remarks,’ so she must have done
that because she really wanted to.” And she read the
line over and over.</p>

<p>Ella’s likes and dislikes were very strong. When
she “left out what form and voice the verb ‘forbid’
was,” and so lost her place at the head, she wrote
that she “didn’t like grammar at all.” In the middle
of the term, when things were a little dull and monotonous,
she wrote forlornly:</p>

<p>“Nothing in particular happened to-day, as indeed
nothing happens any day but to get up, dress, and
start for school; then I study hard all day long and
come home at night, go to studying again, and so on,
the same old routine over and over again, till I am
sure that I am thoroughly sick of it all.”</p>

<p>The trouble was that the lessons had become so
much easier that they no longer kept her fully occupied,
and she had time to find fault.</p>

<p>However, if Ella did find life monotonous, her
teacher did not. The first teacher was ill and out
of school, and a much younger one had taken her
place.</p>

<p>This new teacher was rather too generous with
“extras,” and her pupils soon found out that if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
behaved well four days in the week, they could pile
up extras enough to make up for all the misdeeds
that they could commit on the fifth.</p>

<p>They were very systematic, these naughty children.
Four days they behaved like little saints, studying
quietly and never whispering; but when the fifth
day had come, they wrote notes to one another, they
whispered, they made paper dolls, they wriggled and
they twisted. They manufactured excuses for walking
about the room. How every child could need to go
to the dictionary and the waste-basket at least once
in five minutes was a mystery to the young teacher.
She began to have a nervous dread of Fridays, for
fear visitors might come and would report that her
classes knew absolutely nothing and behaved exactly
as they ought not; for many of her mischievous
pupils carried their game so far as to do little studying
for Fridays.</p>

<p>Ella would never agree to this. Play and failures
in class were two different things. It was fun to play,
but it was a disgrace to fail. Besides, Friday’s lesson
was always Monday’s review lesson, and, as she
very sensibly reasoned, it was better to learn it and
have it done with than to spoil Saturday by having to
learn a double lesson for Monday.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">SHE PLAYED, INDEED SHE DID, SHELTERED BY
A BIG OPEN ATLAS</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But she played, indeed she did, sheltered by a big
open atlas. She made paper dolls and paper furniture,
and she folded into boxes and rowboats and dustpans
and Chinese junks the squares of paper that in after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>years were sacred to the stern labors of the kindergarten.
This bad child made a regular business arrangement
with the little girl who sat in front of her.
If, whenever Ella touched her right shoulder three
times, she would sit up very straight and act as a support
for the open atlas, Ella would give her every
week one paper doll, three fly boxes, and two Chinese
junks.</p>

<p>Of course the teacher could not help seeing part at
least of what was being done “on the Potomac,” as in
her own mind she called Ella’s desk; but she was
really puzzled what to do, and none of her normal
school notebooks gave her the least help. Ella played
so quietly and recited her lessons so well—even on
Fridays—that it was not easy to be severe with her.
How could she be always finding fault with a child
who was invariably respectful to her and who slipped
up to the head of the class so easily, went to the foot
with a store of extras numerous enough to provide for
all emergencies, and in a day or two stood at the head
again, ready to collect more extras? The term would
soon be at an end, and she wisely concluded that she
would not walk around to the rear of the atlas when
she could avoid it.</p>

<p>About this time came the revealing of the great
secret. Ella and Ida still sat together. The paper
dolls of each visited those of the other. They shared
each other’s worsteds and bright-colored papers, and
lent each other new patterns in crocheting and working<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
on canvas and perforated paper. One day, as they
were walking home together after school, Ida said to
Ella,</p>

<p>“We’re best friends, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>“Of course we are,” declared Ella wonderingly.
“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because there’s a secret that we mustn’t tell to
any one but our best friends. It’s the Tories’ Alphabet.”</p>

<p>“What are ‘Tories’?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but this is their alphabet. It’s just
a name for it, I guess. A big girl in the First Room
showed it to me, and told me never to let any one have
it but my best friends. She said that another girl in a
class before that gave it to her. It is an alphabet, and
we can write notes with it, and no matter who finds
one, it can’t be read.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you show it to your mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I showed it to mine after she promised not
to tell any one about it; and you could show it to
yours if she promised.”</p>

<p>School was no longer monotonous. It was a kind
of fairyland where all sorts of marvelous things were
happening. Ella looked back with disdain upon her
days at the seminary and even at the “Private
School for Young Ladies.” If they had lasted all her
life, there would never have been anything so thrilling
as this. There was no doubt now that she was within
the circle to stay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>This is a true copy of the Tories’ Alphabet.</p>

<p>The sudden change that the revealing of this secret
produced was a vast relief to the troubled mind of the
teacher. There was no more making of dolls, no more
folding of kindergarten papers. The tiny bottles of
mucilage disappeared, and never once was a pair of
scissors heard to fall upon the floor. Walk back of the
atlas when you would, there was nothing to be seen—if
you did not come too near—but writing books and
scraps of paper whereupon a little girl with unusually
poor handwriting was apparently trying her best in
her spare time to improve it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>In their mysterious alphabet the two children wrote
notes innumerable to each other, and even copied
long poems, and they might easily have taken up another
study in the time that they gave to it. The
teacher knew of course that something was going on,
but it was such a relief to have them even apparently
at work that she did not open her eyes any wider than
was absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>The end of the second term was at hand, and those
who stood well in the Second Room were to be promoted
to the First Room. Ella was to go. It was an
honor to be promoted, but when the reports were
given out, she went home with a sober face and lagging
steps. Her percentage was 90, and her stand in
the class was Number One for the half term. The
trouble was with the deportment. Much as the teacher
liked her, she could not fairly give her an “Excellent.”
The first half of the term was marked “Good,” and
the second—which began about the time of the revelation
of the secret—was “Very good.” But that
was not “Excellent,” and the mother had told her
that, although a child might not always be able to
take a high stand in her class, she could always be
“Excellent” in deportment. The time of reckoning
had come.</p>

<p>“Was there anything to prevent you from behaving
well?” asked the mother.</p>

<p>“I did behave well four days out of every five, and
sometimes others,” Ella replied. “I might have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
a good deal worse. I might have had an ‘Unsatisfactory’
in deportment and in any one of the seven
studies, or even in all of them, and I didn’t; I only
had a ‘Very good’ in just one thing. I don’t think
that was bad at all. Anyway, I couldn’t help it.”</p>

<p>“Ella,” said the mother, “the doctors say that
often when children seem to be naughty, it is because
they are nervously tired and need more sleep. I think
the thing to do will be for you to go to bed at eight
o’clock every night for the next month. Then you will
be rested enough to behave well when you go into the
First Room.”</p>

<p>Now one of the girls was to have a party during the
next month, and two days of Beejay’s week’s vacation
came within its limits. Then, too, this punishment
touched her pocketbook seriously. She had
never had for a Sunday school teacher a milliner who
would give her bits of ribbon, but she did have one at
that moment who kept a pretty little fancy store.
She was glad of all the mittens that Ella could crochet,
and the little girl was becoming quite a capitalist
on the proceeds. She had planned many nice things
to do with the money that she expected to make; and
now there would be no time for anything but her lessons,
and when the month was over, it would be too
late for mittens.</p>

<p>She had one big cry, then she accepted the situation.
One comfort was that the “month” was February
and that it was not leap year. Another was that when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
the day came for her to move into the First Room,
the young teacher forgot that she was a teacher and a
graduate of the State normal school. She put her arm
around the child and said,</p>

<p>“Ella, if you only wouldn’t play quite so much, I
would not ask for a better scholar—and anyway,
play or no play, you are a dear little girl, and I wish
you were my own small sister.”</p>

<span class="fs80">AMONG THE “WELL-BEHAVED ANGELS”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The class to be promoted met as usual in the Second
Room, and with their books marched into the First
Room. Besides the glory of the promotion, Ella’s
dignity had another foundation, namely, that she
was thoroughly up to date in her equipment. Her
smoothly sliding slate pencil that worked like a gold
one had not yet been surpassed by any new invention,
but the large slate was quite behind the times. The
proper thing now was to have what was apparently a
book about the size of her arithmetic and grammar,
but made up of four small slates, of real slate, but
thin and light, and with slender wooden frames. The
binding of Ella’s was of a bright, cheery shade of blue,
and on the outside was printed in gilt, with a large
Spencerian flourish, “Notes.”</p>

<p>The slate was enough to give elegance to her outfit,
but the crowning touch of distinction was her book-carrier.
Bags had long before gone out of use, if indeed
they had ever been in use in that city. The informal
court of school girls had decided some time
before this that a strap buckled around a little pile
of books would do very well for boys, but was not in
the best taste for their sisters. Moreover, the strap
jammed the edges of the books, and this was an argument<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
against it which was not without force at home,
for even in families of little education a schoolbook
was an article to be tenderly cared for.</p>

<p>Books were not provided by the city and showered
into the hands of pupils to be used or abused according
to disposition and home training, or lack of training,
and then tossed to the following class. They were
to be bought, sometimes with self-denial on the part of
children or their parents, to be neatly covered with
light brown paper or sometimes with some well-wearing
color of calico, and treated with respect. A
new book was an acquisition, an article of value to
have and to hold. Usually the child’s name and the
date of its purchase were written on the flyleaf, often,
by special request, in the handwriting of the teacher.
Books were used for a long time. With all the glory of
promotion to the First Room, only two new books
were to be bought. The same geography, grammar,
speller, and arithmetic were to serve for the two years
before going to the high school.</p>

<p>To carry these precious volumes a new article had
recently been invented. The books were laid between
two parallel pieces of wood with a strong cord running
through holes at either end and wound up by a
little wheel and ratchet under the handle. The slight
snap that the wheel made in catching was exceedingly
agreeable to the ears of little schoolgirl owners.</p>

<p>These carriers were not yet very common; but Ella
had with considerable foresight and crocheting of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
mittens prepared for the future; and now when all the
boys and most of the girls marched into the First
Room with jagged armfuls of books and slates, Ella,
and two or three others carried only neatly screwed
up carriers carefully packed with the largest books at
the bottom and the smallest at the top, especially
when the smallest was a new notebook slate.</p>

<p>The principal sat on the platform, and as Ella went
by, she gave him a friendly little smile which he found
himself returning. The assistant was assigning seats.
These were given out according to the rank of the
pupil for the last quarter. Ella had been Number One,
and so the place of honor, the seat in the farthest corner
from the front, was given to her. Alma sat beside
her. Back of her was a wall, and on her right side was
another wall.</p>

<p>Alma was a quiet girl who studied hard, and Ella
liked her; but Alma never whispered, not even if she
had plenty of extras to spare, and, Ella feared, would
not even “communicate.” The assistant had explained
what was meant by “communicating.” If
you smiled at anyone or nodded your head, or took up
your deskmate’s pencil with a look that meant, “May
I use this?” you were communicating. In short, you
were expected to behave “as if you were entirely alone
in the room,” said the assistant.</p>

<p>Ella had meant to be very, very good in this new
room, but expectations of such preternatural excellence
alarmed her. She felt like a naughty little imp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
dropped by mistake into a roomful of particularly
well-behaved angels. Just then she looked up and
caught sight of a vacant chair standing near the assistant’s
place on the platform. That was where she
had sat to do the examples that had admitted her to
the Second Room. It was five months ago. None of
the First Roomers had paid any attention to her. She
was quite beneath them. And now she herself was a
First Roomer. She was no longer a naughty little imp,
she was one of the particularly well-behaved angels.
She was twelve years old, and in two years she would
go to the high school. She sat up very straight and
arranged her books in her half of the desk with much
dignity.</p>

<p>Ella had supposed that the lessons would be harder
in the First Room, and she was surprised to find
that they were no more difficult than in the Second
Room, though perhaps a little more accuracy was required—if
that was possible.</p>

<p>The spelling lessons were always written. “People
rarely spell words orally,” declared the principal.
“Nine tenths of the time they write them. What is
needed is the ability to spell correctly on paper, and
to spell without the slightest hesitation.”</p>

<p>The first step in this undertaking was to cut foolscap
paper into strips between two and three inches
wide. This was done by the principal in primitive
fashion, that is, with a jackknife and ruler. They
were sold to the pupils at eight strips for a cent. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
spelling was called, each child wrote her name at the
top of a strip, dipped her pen into the ink, and squared
for instant action. The assistant took her stand beside
one of the swiftest writers of the class and gave out
words selected from the lesson of the day, as rapidly
as they could be written. Every word must be correct
at the first writing. In the first place, there was no
time to make any change. In the second place, the
attempt was always discovered. Even a shower of
little blots, carefully made to resemble the work of a
spluttering pen, and incidentally to conceal a mistake,
availed nothing. The papers were corrected by the
pupils, and never was one allowed to pass with even
an undotted <em>i</em> or an uncrossed <em>t</em>.</p>

<p>Straight through the spelling book the children
went, reviewing over and over again what they had
learned in the lower rooms, and adding to their knowledge
by “advance lessons.” They learned columns of
words in which <em>ire</em>, <em>yre</em>, <em>ier</em>, <em>iar</em>, <em>igher</em>, and <em>uyer</em> have
the same sound; others in which <em>c</em>, <em>d</em>, and <em>ch</em> are silent;
they learned words that hunt in couples, pronounced
alike but spelled differently and ridiculously apart in
meaning; and finally they learned some 1500 of those
words of the English language that may be counted
upon almost with certainty to produce a crop of failures.</p>

<p>Fifty words were written each day, and to win the
longed for 100 per cent, every one of them must be
above suspicion. There were examinations in spelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
of course, and as a kind of supertest, the class was one
day required to write from dictation on the spur of
the moment, the following sentence:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>It is an agreeable sight to witness the unparalleled embarrassment
of the harassed peddler, attempting to gauge
the symmetry of an onion which a sibyl had peeled with
a poniard, regardless of the innuendoes of the lilies of carnelian
hue.</p>
</div>

<p>Pupils who ranked high were given in turn the
charge of the report book. This was an honor, but
also a great responsibility. There were no mistakes
in that book, for every figure was watched. “I am
keeping my own report very rigidly myself this term,”
wrote Ella, “so as to see if there is any foul play.”</p>

<p>Keeping the reports was not only a responsible but
a complicated matter. To begin with, there were
“whole failures” and “half failures.” A downright
“I don’t know” was a whole failure. A slightly muddled
recitation, not all wrong and not all right, was a
half failure. Then, too, there were extras to be considered
and taken account of. Sometimes these were
promised in advance, but generally they were given
unexpectedly for some specially good piece of work.
A particularly good map, an unusually clear recitation
of some difficult point, sometimes won from one to
ten extras. On one never-to-be-forgotten day, when
there was a very hard lesson in grammar, the assistant
gave to every one who did not fail ten good solid
extras, thus deeply arousing the regret of those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
would have studied harder if they had guessed what
she meant to do.</p>

<p>Grammar was in the hands of the assistant, and it
was whispered among awestruck children that the
author of the grammar—author of a printed book!—had
said that he wished he could teach his own
book as well as she. Could there be greater glory? In
the lower rooms, a smaller grammar was used; but on
entering the Second Room this larger textbook came
to its own, and was used every day for two years and a
half. It never occurred to any one that the children
might cease to be interested and that it would be
better to make a change every little while. The
grammar was there to be learned, and learned thoroughly.</p>

<p>When they came to the list of prepositions, Ella was
appalled. She had never had the training of the lower
grades in learning unrelated words, and to learn this
list of sixty-four was much worse than lists of productions.
She asked the assistant:</p>

<p>“Why do we have to learn that list?”</p>

<p>“So that you will recognize a preposition when you
come to it.”</p>

<p>“But I always do.”</p>

<p>“How do you know one?”</p>

<p>“Just the same way I know a kitten. If it behaves
like a kitten, it is a kitten. If it behaves like a preposition,
it is a preposition.”</p>

<p>The assistant laughed. “It is true that you always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
do know a preposition,” she said thoughtfully. “The
others learned that list in the lower rooms, and without
it I am afraid some of them would not know a
preposition from a kitten. We’ll talk this over some
day.”</p>

<p>Ella wisely concluded that she need not learn the
list, but that she must not tell any one of her privilege.
Her experience at the seminary as a “faculty child”
had taught her never to reveal faculty secrets, and
this one was never told. The assistant did not mention
the matter again, but Ella noticed that one day
when the embarrassing question would naturally have
fallen to her, it was given to some one else.</p>

<p>One evening at the close of the first term in the
First Room, Ella did some counting and measuring
of paragraphs. Then she said:</p>

<p>“Mother, we have been over only twenty-two
pages this whole term. Of course there are exercises
besides, but what we have really learned, if it was
printed together solidly, would make only seven.”</p>

<p>“I will speak to the assistant if you like,” said the
mother, “and ask her if she can arrange to give you
longer lessons.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” cried Ella in some alarm. “If the lessons
were longer, there wouldn’t be any time to read and
play and crochet and draw and go to see the other
girls and have them come to see me. But I was just
thinking how it would sound if I should get to be
a famous woman some day and any one asked how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
much grammar I used to do in a term, and you would
have to say, ‘Seven pages.’ Then people would think
I must have been horribly stupid.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” advised the mother with a smile.
“Before you are a famous woman, there will be time
enough to go over more pages. Just learn everything
thoroughly. That’s all you have to do now.”</p>

<p>“I do learn everything thoroughly,” declared Ella.
“I have to, if I am going to stay at the head of the
class—and I am,” she added with emphasis. “Anyway,
I like grammar. I don’t like learning rules, of
course, and when I give an illustration that is just as
good as the one in the book and a great deal more
sensible, I don’t see why it should be called wrong. I
recited, ‘The adverbial element may be an adverbial
clause denoting time.’ The illustration was ‘While I
was musing, the fire burned.’ Now when you’re musing,
the fire doesn’t burn, it goes out, or at any rate it
burns low; so I said, ‘While I was musing, the fire
burned low.’ The sentence contained an adverbial
clause, and it was good sense and the way fires behave,
and it sounded better; but it was counted half
a failure. I don’t think that was fair; but I do like
parsing and analyzing. It’s real fun to shake a sentence
all to pieces till it has to tell you just what it
means and what it didn’t intend you should ever
know. It’s as much fun as any game. But when an
illustration illustrates, it does illustrate. It’s right,
and I don’t see how it could be any more right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps when you become that famous woman,
you can write a grammar that will keep every little
girl at the head of the class and never allow any one
to fail.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t believe I’d care so much about being
at the head if every one else was there. Do you think
it’s selfish to want to be at the head?”</p>

<p>“How should you feel if some other girl was always
at the head? That’s the way to find out,” said the
mother.</p>

<p>“I suppose I shouldn’t like it,” Ella replied
thoughtfully. “But I like the principal, and I have
reason to think that he likes me, and he would be disappointed
if I failed on purpose and went down. It
would not be right to disappoint him, would it?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the mother, “it would be wrong not to
do your best; but you must try just as hard to be kind
to all the boys and girls as you do to stand at the
head.”</p>

<p>“There’s one boy who doesn’t like me,” said Ella
meditatively, “and I never did a thing to him. He
told the assistant to-day that I was drawing a picture.
She told me to bring it to the desk. I was trying to
copy the ‘Landing of the Pilgrims’ from our history.
She looked at it, and then she said, ‘Ella has taken
great pains with it, and it is very well done. Learn
your lessons as well as she does, and you may
draw, too. And remember that I do not like tale-bearing.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>“I hope you didn’t smile and look pleased when she
said that.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t—neither did the boy. I did make
up a face, though,” she added a moment later.</p>

<p>“Why, Ella!”</p>

<p>“Oh, just in my mind, I mean. It didn’t do him
any harm, and it made me feel a whole lot better.”</p>

<span class="fs80">ELLA AND THE PRINCIPAL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Ella was right in thinking that the principal liked
her. He was severe, often harsh. Sometimes he
seemed to delight in making the children uncomfortable,
and even in punishing them. When he read the
Bible in the opening exercises, he had a way of emphasizing
verses about liars and thieves that made
his most truthful and honest pupils cringe and think
that they <em>must</em> have said something that was false
or done something dishonest. With a voice of scorn
and utter contempt he would read, “I cannot dig;
to beg I am ashamed,” and then apply the verses
to those pupils who were too lazy to dig, but were not
ashamed to beg their classmates for help.</p>

<p>Ella was perhaps the one child in school who was
not afraid of him. The only time that he had ever
shown to her his liking to frighten and tantalize children
was on the day when he had sent for her to come
to his office; and that little interview had ended so
happily that she always thought of it as a jest. Then,
too, he had once known the dead father whose memory
she worshiped, and that was enough to win her
heart.</p>

<p>To this principal it was something new in all his
years of teaching to find himself caring what any
pupil thought of him; but it was a fact that when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
had made some harsh speech and then caught Ella’s
look of surprise and regret, he felt uncomfortable. He
would have been amazed if any one had said, “You
are much more gentle and kindly because you want
that child to think well of you,” but it was true nevertheless.</p>

<p>The arithmetic was his share of the teaching, and
he conducted it by methods that were successful certainly,
but never used in any other school in the city.
He was quite likely to break into a rather lame explanation
of a problem by handing the one who was
reciting a foot-rule and saying, “Go and measure
those steps across the street and find out how many
square feet of boards are in them”; or, “There’s a pile
of wood in the next yard. Go and find out how many
cords there are.” Once when he thought a class
needed waking up, he suddenly asked, “What would
happen if an irresistible force should meet an immovable
body?” Again he demanded, “Why can’t a
man lift himself up by his bootstraps?” Another
time he sent a boy for a wooden rolling hoop. When
it arrived, he held it firmly to the chalk ledge of the
blackboard, and marked one point on the hoop where
it touched the ledge and another exactly opposite that
one. Then he turned the hoop a little and demanded,
“Why does the point at the top move over more
distance than the opposite point at the bottom? You
can see that the whole hoop is moving, can’t you?
Why don’t they keep together?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>There would be reasons why it did and why it
didn’t, until when he thought the class were thoroughly
waked up, he would turn back to the lesson
and go on as if there had been no interruption. He
was as fond of cube root as if it had been a pet child
of his own, and when Ella’s class came to that corner
of the arithmetic, he took it almost as a personal
grievance that they complained of the difficulty.</p>

<p>“You try to do it without thinking,” he declared
wrathfully. “If you have just three minutes in which
to do something new, take two of them to think out
what is the best and quickest way to do it. Cube root
is the finest thing in the arithmetic. Miss Ella doesn’t
groan over it,” he added, “and you ought to be able
to do it as well as she.”</p>

<p>“Ella’s done it before,” said a boy. “She did it before
she ever came to this school. She said so.”</p>

<p>The principal’s fine little speech was spoiled. Probably
he had never come so near being angry with her.
When the class was over, he called her to the desk.
“Miss Ella—Ella,” he said, “you must always remember
that there are some things which it is better
not to tell.”</p>

<p>He had quite a liking for making his pupils turn
teachers. Sometimes he would say to a boy or girl in
the middle of a recitation, “You may take the class
now”; and he would sit back restfully in his big chair
on the platform with his eyes half closed.</p>

<p>It was an honor to be asked to hear a class, but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
was hardly a pleasure, for the gentleman in the chair
was not so sleepy as he seemed, and woe to the substitute
teacher if he allowed the slightest mistake to
pass.</p>

<p>Sometimes when the teacher of a lower room was
absent, he would send one of the First Roomers in to
take her place.</p>

<p>“Tell them,” he would say, “to multiply 1 by 2;
that product by 3; that by 4; and so on until they
have multiplied by 26. Then let every one who has it
right go home.”</p>

<p>“Will you please give me the right answer?” the
young substitute teacher would ask, and he would
reply with apparent indifference,</p>

<p>“Oh, I haven’t it. You can do it while the others
are at work”—not an especially easy thing for a
child of twelve to do, particularly as he knew well that
the principal would look in every little while to make
sure that everything was going on in orderly fashion.</p>

<p>Hearing one another’s lessons was common, and
correcting one another’s papers; but Ella had an experience
in teaching that went far beyond this. One
day the principal called her and said,</p>

<p>“Miss Ella—Ella—there’s a boy in the office who
says he never understood why you invert the divisor.
I want you to go in and explain it to him.”</p>

<p>In a minute Ella came back and said,</p>

<p>“There is a man in there, but there isn’t any boy.”</p>

<p>“Well, boy—man—it is all the same. Just go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
back and explain it to him as if he was a small boy.”</p>

<p>Ella’s seminary experiences came in play. She
had been so used to being counted with grown-ups
when she was a member of the “Literary and Scientific
Course” that she did not feel the least bit embarrassed
or awkward, but explained and cut up an
apple to illustrate as easily and naturally as if the
strange man had been the boy whom she was expecting
to find.</p>

<p>“Did he understand?” asked the principal when
she returned to the schoolroom.</p>

<p>“He said he did,” Ella replied.</p>

<p>“I should think he did,” the principal said to Ella’s
mother afterwards. “He has been teaching—you
can guess how well—somewhere in the backwoods,
and he is trying to learn a little something before he
goes back. He said he never understood before why
you invert the divisor, but I think he will always remember
now.”</p>

<p>Most of the work in the First Room was merely a
continuation of that in the Second, but there were
two new books to be bought and two entirely new
subjects to be taken up. One of these new subjects
was the writing of compositions. This was the dread
of the whole class.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you should dread that,” said the
mother. “You liked to write your ‘Little Pearls’
when you were only eight years old; and you and Boy
Cousin had a fine time writing the ‘Bearcamp Books.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
I have seen you spend half an evening over ‘Parker’s
Aids to Composition.’ You liked that.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Ella thoughtfully, “but I picked out
from Parker’s just what I liked to do. There were
sentences with a word left out, and there were sentences
where one word was used till I was tired of it.
It was just like a puzzle in a paper to make those
right; it was play. And when Boy Cousin and I wrote
the ‘Bearcamp Books,’ we only wrote the things that
came into our own heads. The girls in the First Class
say that in school compositions we have to write the
things that come into other people’s heads.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t know how to get them out?” said
the mother with a smile. “Wait till your first subject
is given you, and perhaps it won’t be so bad as you
think.”</p>

<p>“The First Class had to write last year on ‘The
Seasons,’ ‘Taste and Fashion,’ ‘Books of Value,’
‘Art and Artists,’ ‘What costs nothing is worth nothing’;
and I am sure as sure that I haven’t a word to
say about those,” said Ella dolefully.</p>

<p>When the first subject was given, it proved to be
“Printing.” Ella tried her best to produce what she
thought was in grown-people’s minds about it. She
read the articles on printing in two encyclopædias,
and then she set to work. After many struggles she
wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>The honour of inventing printing is usually given to
Gutenberg. Scarcely anything is known of his life until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
the age of thirty-six, when he entered into a contract with
a certain company, promising to impart to them whatever
knowledge he possessed concerning the secret of printing.
The company probably intended to commence the
practice of this art, but their plans were frustrated by the
death of one of the leading members of the association.</p>
</div>

<p>So Ella wrote, primly and stiffly, as she imagined
grown-ups always did when they wrote for one another.
She even spelled the familiar “honor” with a
<em>u</em>, because it had a <em>u</em> in the encyclopædia, and she
supposed it ought to have one in a composition.</p>

<p>She struggled with that composition with an energy
worthy of a better result; and when it was returned,
the world seemed hollow as she read, “Spelling, 5 off,”
and saw that the guilty cause of her loss was that
word “honour.” Farther down the page, however,
there was a comforting little note, “10 extras for the
expressions being your own.” Her own, indeed!</p>

<p>One of the two new books bought for use in the
First Room was a Sixth Reader. Remembering that
the date of its publication was 1866, one can almost
name the articles of prose and poetry of which it consisted.
Compiled at the close of the Civil War and
only fourscore years after the American Revolution,
there was of course much about union and freedom
and independence. There was the eloquence of Webster
and the “Gettysburg speech” of Lincoln; there
was “Sheridan’s Ride” and “The Ride of Paul
Revere,” and “The Antiquity of Freedom.”</p>

<p>The United States was young and strong, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
natural reaction reading books for children, as well as
volumes of selections for older folk, contained many
articles about death. In the Sixth Reader was the
gruesome tale of Ginevra, who in sport hid in a great
chest on her wedding day and was suffocated therein,
her body not being found till many years afterwards;
there was the “Death of Little Nell,” “Over the
River,” “The Conqueror’s Grave,” the “Burial of
Sir John Moore,” the story of the Indian who was
swept over Niagara Falls, and an especially vivid
account of the horrors of the French Revolution.
Against all the theories of pedagogy, such thoughts as
these were chosen to put into youthful minds—and
did them not one bit of harm. The country was all
a-thrill with energy, and here in the children’s reader
was much of meditative prose and poetry, “The Old
Clock on the Stair,” the “Address to a Mummy,”
Byron’s “Apostrophe to the Ocean,” Collins’s “Ode
to the Passions,” and Gray’s “Elegy in a Country
Churchyard”—and the strange part of it all was
that the children actually enjoyed these serious
writings.</p>

<p>No one, least of all the children themselves, ever
demanded entertaining stories in the reading class or
a frequent change of readers any more than they
demanded interesting examples in arithmetic or a
change in the spelling of words or in the multiplication
table. The same selections were read over and
over, but no one seemed bored by the repetition. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
secret was that when the reader was taken in hand, no
one expected to be amused. Every one realized that
there was some definite work to do. What the author
meant must be discovered. Then one after another
was called on to read the same paragraph or
stanza until the teacher was satisfied that the thought
had been fully brought out. The selections in the
reader were carefully chosen to give scope to thought
and expression. To read well was regarded as an
accomplishment. The best reader in the room was
looked upon with envy and admiration. Visitors often
asked if they might hear a class in reading.</p>

<p>As has been said, when the reader was taken in
hand, every one in the class realized that there was
work to be done; but of course not all succeeded
equally well in doing it. One pupil declared his belief
that a “storied urn” meant an urn “that you could
tell a lot of stories about.” Another demanded with
emphasis,</p>

<div class="poetry-container fs90">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br>
<span class="fs80">WHEN THE COMMITTEE MEN CAME</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The second new book that was purchased in honor of
the First Room was a history of the United States.
This was quite a grown-up history with its three hundred
pages besides the Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution. There were maps and pictures.
There were even detailed maps of many battles. There
were “chronological reviews,” which consisted of long
lists of dates, each with its proper event attached.
They were recited at express train speed as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>1607. Jamestown was founded.</p>

<p>1609. Hudson discovered the Hudson River.</p>

<p>1610. The starving time.</p>

<p>1619. The first legislative assembly in America was convened
in Virginia.</p>
</div>

<p>The book was not interesting, but it was well
written. Ella’s heart was won by the first sentence.
This read, “The honor of the discovery of America belongs
to Christopher Columbus as an individual, and
to Spain as a nation.” The swing, the balance of the
words pleased her. She did not know whether it was
good or bad, but she did know that she liked it and
liked to say it over and over.</p>

<p>The first draft of her composition on “Printing”
read, “The honor of inventing printing belongs to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
Gutenberg as an individual and to Germany as a nation.”
But she decided that it was not quite fair to
borrow the sound of a whole sentence from some one
else; so she compromised by taking half of it.</p>

<p>At the end of the second day’s use of the book, she
came home quite in despair.</p>

<p>“I just can’t do it,” she lamented. “I thought it
was nice, for it told about Columbus when he was a
boy, and about his trying so hard to get some rich
king to help him find the way to India by sailing
across the Atlantic. The assistant said she did not
want us to learn it word for word, and I didn’t. I told
it just as I would a story; and I left out that he studied
geometry; and it was counted a half failure. I don’t
see why any one could not cross the ocean without
studying geometry; and I haven’t the least idea what
geometry is, anyway.”</p>

<p>The history went on with struggles and unhappiness,
for it was never easy for Ella to learn anything
word for word, and she found that while this was
neither required nor desired, it was nevertheless the
only way to make sure of bringing in every detail, and
thus avoiding failures and half failures.</p>

<p>Through discoveries and colonies and Indian wars
she toiled and part way through the Revolutionary
War. Then one day a little girl with bright eyes and
glowing cheeks threw open the door of her home and
cried:</p>

<p>“I can do it now, mother. They never seemed like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
real people, but they do now, and some of them are
buried in our own cemetery. I found one just now
that said, ‘Fell at Bunker Hill.’”</p>

<p>This was rather confused, but little by little the
mother understood the situation. An old Revolutionary
cemetery lay in the heart of the city, and through
it ran the nearest way to school. The city authorities
would have been glad to get rid of it and took no care
of the place, made no repairs, and did not object to its
being used as a playground. Most of the stone wall
around it had tumbled down. Monuments were lying
on the ground, the door of a tomb had been shattered;
but yet it was beautiful, for flowers grew everywhere.
Under the trees were white stars of Bethlehem. Violets,
daisies, and buttercups were scattered through
the grass. Shady lots were covered with periwinkle,
and sunny ones were bright and cheery with trim
little none-so-pretties. Lilacs, white roses, red roses,
and yellow Harrison roses peered through the broken
palings of the fences. Lilies of the valley ran in
friendly fashion from one lot to another. In spite of
the neglect, or perhaps because of it, the old cemetery
was a happy place for children, and they enjoyed it.
On the way home it had suddenly entered Ella’s head
to compare the dates on the stones with those in her
history; and in a flash the whole story became real.
She had found not only the grave of one who was
killed at Bunker Hill, but of one who had been with
John Paul Jones in battle on the sea. From that day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
history was as real to Ella as the things she could
remember in her own life.</p>

<p>She told Alma about her discovery.</p>

<p>“Do you believe we ought to play here,” said Alma,
“now that they seem like real living people?”</p>

<p>But Ella had not forgotten her fancy that the dead
folk of the little churchyard in the mountains liked to
have people come there to eat their Sunday lunch and
chat a little together. She remembered too one day
when her father and mother and she were walking in a
cemetery. She was a tiny child and she began to play
on one of the graves. The mother called her away,
but the father said, “Oh, let her play. I think if I were
there, I should like to have little children come and
play around my grave.”</p>

<p>She said to Alma rather shyly,</p>

<p>“I think maybe they’d like to have us.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they would,” said Alma, “if we played
gently and had kind thoughts about them.”</p>

<p>“Of course we should play gently,” said Ella.
“We’re not small children any longer. We shall go to
the high school in one year more. Oh, I want to go
now. I want to be grown up. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Perhaps. Why do you want to?”</p>

<p>“One reason is so I can go up in the Fourth of July
balloon. I’ve always wanted to, and I will if I ever
have five dollars that I can spend just as I like. I suppose
I shan’t ever ride in a swanboat, for I’m too old.
But let’s go on with the history lesson. Perhaps we’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
find that some of the people in it are here. If they are,
let’s pick some flowers and put on their graves.”</p>

<p>With this new inspiration the children roamed
about the old cemetery, examining dates and inscriptions.</p>

<p>“Here’s one marked ‘Howe,’” said Ella, “and it
says that he died in battle in 1778.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he was related to Admiral Howe,” Alma
suggested.</p>

<p>“How he must have felt, then, to have his own uncle—I
guess he was an uncle—fighting against the
Americans,” said Ella. “Suppose it had been Washington
who died in 1778?” she added thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Then maybe we’d be under a king or a queen.
How queer it would be to talk about ‘Her Majesty
the Queen of Great Britain and the United States of
America.’”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe we’d be under a queen at all.
Something would have been sure to happen.”</p>

<p>Both the little girls looked forward with pleasure to
the recitation in history on the following day, but
they were disappointed, for just before the class was
to be called, visitors came in and asked especially if
they might hear one of the classes in reading.</p>

<p>There were of course more visitors to the First
Room than to the lower grades. One was the superintendent
of schools. He used to drop in informally,
chat a little in a friendly fashion, and then, when the
boys and girls were quite at their ease, he would examine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
a class or two, look at the maps that had been
drawn, make a note, both aloud and in his notebook,
of anything that he especially liked, and say good-bye
quite as if he had been visiting at their homes.</p>

<p>Members of the school committee had the privilege
of making speeches to the pupils. If a man could win
a place on this committee, he could, even if he had no
talent for public speaking, enjoy all the rewards of
eloquence, for he was sure of an audience who would
hang upon his words and whose faces would express
genuine regret when his speech was evidently drawing
to a close.</p>

<p>It was Ella who let the secret out. Once after there
had been an address that was both long and dull, the
assistant said to her at recess:</p>

<p>“I was pleased to see how attentive you were to
our visitor this morning. That was real courtesy.”</p>

<p>“I wanted him to keep on talking,” Ella replied.</p>

<p>“Did you?” questioned the assistant, with a note
of surprise that would slip into her voice, quite against
her intentions.</p>

<p>“Yes, because if he had talked only ten minutes
longer, it would have been too late to have any geography
recitation, and I didn’t know the lesson so very
well,” replied Ella serenely. “I tried to look just as
interested as I possibly could, so he would keep on
talking.”</p>

<p>Even if the committee men were not all the most
eloquent of public speakers, they rarely failed to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
something definite to say and to say it in a way that
would make it “stick,” which after all is about as
much as any orator can hope to accomplish. One of
them brought a stranger with him one day, who asked
to see the drawing of maps on the blackboard from
memory.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the principal. “Class in geography.—What
is your State?” he asked the guest.</p>

<p>“Georgia,” the guest replied.</p>

<p>“The class may put an outline of Georgia on the
board,” said the principal. “North—northeast—east—southwest.
Put in the ranges of mountains.”
Six rivers were drawn in and the location of six towns
marked. It was done too rapidly for even a glance at
a neighbor’s map, and with few mistakes.</p>

<p>When the maps were done, the guest spoke highly
of the work, the accuracy and the speed manifested.
“It was quite a coincidence,” he said, “that their
lesson should have been my own State.”</p>

<p>“Their lesson was on Southern Asia,” said the principal
quietly, “but what they have once learned, they
are responsible for at any moment. Will you say a
few words to the pupils?” he asked the committee
man, for that was the courtesy demanded by the
occasion.</p>

<p>The committee man rose rather ponderously and
looked the room over. Then he said:</p>

<p>“You’ve studied about the equator, of course; and
now I want to know what a ship does when it comes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
to the equator. Does it sail over it, or break through
it, or what?”</p>

<p>No one said a word. The duller pupils were a little
shy. The brighter ones were afraid of some catch, and
there was silence. The committee man looked up and
down the class. Finally, he pointed his long finger to
the farthest corner of the room and said:</p>

<p>“I’d like that boy with red hair to answer the
question.”</p>

<p>The boy with red hair was sensitive about bright
colors. His face turned scarlet while the rest of the
class giggled.</p>

<p>“I want that boy with red hair to answer,” repeated
the committee man. “I’ve noticed that when
a boy has red hair, he usually has some pretty good
brains under it.”</p>

<p>The laugh was turned. The boy with red hair now
plucked up courage and said, “The equator is an imaginary
line. There is nothing to get over.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said the committee man. “You are the
kind of boy I thought you were. Now, don’t forget
that the equator isn’t the only difficulty in the world
that you will find to be imaginary when you come to
it. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Another visitor told interesting stories about the
little red schoolhouse that he attended as a boy, about
getting out of bed before light cold winter mornings to
help with the farm work before he went to school; of
ploughing his way through snowdrifts, of making hay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
and digging potatoes and threshing grain, of working
all day in the hot sun.</p>

<p>“Now, boys,” he said at the close, “I have a secret
to tell you. You think it’s rather hard—don’t you?—to
be called at eight o’clock in the morning, eat
breakfast, and get to school by nine? Well, the secret
is that while you are making yourselves comfortable
the country boys are making themselves ready to
come here to the city a few years from now to take
your places. I wonder what you are going to do about
it. You want those good places, and there is just one
way by which you can hold on to them. It is this,
‘Work hard and don’t grumble.’”</p>

<p>Another committee man talked about perseverance.
At the end of his little address he said:</p>

<p>“We have been talking about perseverance, and
now I am going to ask you to do something that will
make you remember this talk as long as you live. I
want you to sing ‘Go on, go on, go on, go on,’ to the
tune of ‘Auld Lang Syne.’”</p>

<p>It was sung, and there is no question that it was
remembered.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE HIGH SCHOOL EXAMINATIONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">One day at the beginning of Ella’s second year in the
First Room, the superintendent came to the school
and brought with him a stranger, a quiet gentleman
with a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose that is the one?” was the question
signaled from one to another.</p>

<p>Three days of the term had passed, and the principal
had not appeared. All sorts of rumors were floating
about. It was said that he had leave of absence,
that he was sick, and finally, that he had resigned and
that a new principal might step in at any moment.
The assistant was quite equal to the management of
the school, and everything was going on well.</p>

<p>The superintendent introduced the stranger to her;
then, turning toward the pupils, he introduced to
them their new principal. Fortunately it was near the
close of the session, for no rules against “communicating”
or even whispering could have long suppressed
the comparing of notes that was all ready to burst
forth. There was no playing on the homeward way
that noon; the children were too eager to tell the great
news.</p>

<p>Ella was an ardent little partisan. Whatever the
principal was to others, he had always been kind to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
her, and she wrote forlornly in her little diary, “Another
king arose which knew not Joseph.”</p>

<p>Of course some different ways of doing things were
introduced, and Ella was certain that the older ways
were far better. In arithmetic, it had been forbidden
to preserve any written work. What was wanted was
the ability to do a problem; why preserve it then, if
you have the ability to do it at any time? The new
way was to keep your problems in a blank book, each
one fenced off from the others by a carefully ruled
double line, and have them to refer to at any moment.
There were good reasons for both ways.</p>

<p>The plan of map-drawing had been to study a map
till you had a picture of it in your mind, then to draw
that picture on paper or on the blackboard. The new
way was to make as nearly an outline of the country
to be drawn as could be made with straight lines, and
then fit the true outline of the country around it.
This worked very well if one happened to remember
just how many “measures” long each line of the outline
should be; but if the proper length of any one line
was forgotten, the pupil was all at sea. The numbers
had gone from his mind, and he had no mental picture
of the map. Ella’s diary called it “a queer, conglomerated
way of drawing Europe.”</p>

<p>Gradually the new principal made his way. Every
lesson had to be learned as carefully as ever, but there
was a margin to the work. When strange kinds of
woods appeared in the list of “productions” that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
the children’s horror, the new principal was quite
likely to bring some specimens of them to school, and
perhaps to invite a group of those children who
seemed most interested to spend the evening at his
house to see the rest of his cabinet of woods. With
him a company went not only to the asbestus ledge,
but to a coal mine not far away where they could collect
some fossils. He had a valuable microscope, and
this he brought to school to reveal the marvels of
little things.</p>

<p>So passed the spring term. In those days the spring
term began the school year, so that when Ella returned
to school in September, she had only three
terms more before going to the high school.</p>

<p>It was soon plain that much of the rest of the year
would be given to preparation for the high school
examinations. Every study was reviewed most thoroughly,
from the beginning of the book to the end.
For a while geography was recited twice a day, once
to the new principal and once to the assistant. Every
question in the little pink geographical question book
was asked by the teacher and answered by the pupils.
The principal exports of Europe, fifty-three articles,
were recited over and over. A table of the latitude
and longitude of fifty-six places, a thing to give one
bad dreams, was repeated in chorus and in solo. More
than once the time sacred to the reading class was
given to going over the United States or some other
country, naming boundaries, rivers, and cities. Maps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
were drawn until the children could almost have
drawn them with their eyes shut. The new principal
said it was never his way to offer prizes; but if it had
been, he would have offered one long ago for the best
map of Europe. “Draw just as good a map as you
can,” he said to the First Class, “and we will see
about the prizes afterwards.”</p>

<p>The other studies were reviewed in much the same
way as the geography. There was more teaching
than the teachers could do, and some of the pupils
were pressed into the service. Ella hardly recited
at all, she was so busy hearing others. Among
these were two girls who were sent to her in the office
every day. “See if you can possibly make them
understand how to analyze a sentence,” said the
assistant almost hopelessly.</p>

<p>There were written examinations without end.
Surely the children ought to have been well used to
them, for they lived and breathed examinations every
few days, especially in grammar and arithmetic.
Among these examinations were full sets of the questions
used for entrance to the high school for the last
twelve years, and every one of these was given to the
class in hand. The children of the sixties must have
been tough little things, for not one of them had
nervous prostration.</p>

<p>As the weeks passed on, the work became more
and more intense. Every question in the geographical
question book had been answered, as has been said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
Every topic in history was recited and every map
of a battle reviewed. “Miscellaneous Problems” from
numerous arithmetics were now showered upon the
children’s heads like avalanches. Weird and incredible
tales these problems were, tales of men who
bought goods on the most impossible terms and sold
them in fractional lots of most uncomfortable size;
tales of a group of men who bought a grindstone in
partnership and left to the members of the First Class
the task of finding out how many inches each should
grind off to get his money’s worth. Did any one ever
work on that problem without a mental vow never,
never to buy a share in a partnership grindstone,
especially well in toward the center?</p>

<p>The rules of the grammar were thoroughly reviewed
and then came a great expanse of opportunity for
parsing and analyzing. On pages and pages of the
Sixth Reader difficult words were underlined for parsing.
The most complicated sentences were carefully
dissected, and incidentally a habit of looking closely
into the exact meaning of words and the precise shade
of thought which they expressed was formed. The
study of grammar was much more than a repetition
of rules. It had a wide and generous margin. It took
the place in the grammar school that is filled by logic
in the college.</p>

<p>In spelling, the knowledge of one book was all that
was required. Indeed, there was once quite a little
insurrection when, in one of the test examinations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
the word “pusillanimous” appeared, a word which
was not in the spelling book. About music there was
grave questioning. Many of the pupils were taking
lessons at home, and some were doing quite advanced
work. Was it fair to compare this with the work of
children whose only instruction came from an hour
a week in school? “There will always be a difference
in home advantages,” said the wise superintendent,
“but these examinations should be limited to what
they have had full opportunity to learn in school.”
It was decided that the examination in music should
be given, but should not be counted in ranking the
pupils.</p>

<p>This matter of rank was of vast importance in the
eyes of the children, and was watched with interest by
some thousands of the older folk of the city. The high
school examinations were not given in the grammar
schools, but in the high school—which gave to them
an added dignity. The papers were corrected with the
utmost care and were then ranked according to their
percentage. The city was proud of her schools, and
to stand Number One in these examinations was
looked upon as being the highest honor that it could
bestow upon a pupil entering the high school.</p>

<p>This was Ella’s ambition. “I want it! I want it!
I want it!” she said to herself. “It seems as if I must
have it.” But would she get it? Ever since the first
half-term she had been at the head of her class. She
had become used to this, and had fallen into the habit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
of writing carelessly in her diary, “Reports to-day. I
was Number One as usual,” and then had forgotten
it all and had crocheted a mitten or played ball without
thinking any more about it. This, however, was
quite different. Her work was to be compared with
that of the pupils of the First Class in all the grammar
schools of the city. It is no wonder that she
was anxious.</p>

<p>The last day of school arrived. Ella went through
the exercises almost in a dream. She began to realize
that she was going into a strange new school, and she
was half afraid. After the day was over and the guests
had gone, the whole class wrote their names on the
board with “Graduating Class of 1869. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>On the following morning a long procession of boys
and girls wound its way up the hill to the high school.
They were distributed among the different rooms.
Each room was in charge of a teacher, and Ella was
delighted to find the assistant standing by the door
in her room, ready to welcome her. The place of
honor was given to arithmetic; first written, then
mental arithmetic. It was “mental” indeed, for not
one figure was allowed to be written. The pupils did
the examples in their minds as best they could, then
set down the answer; and they had had so much practice
in keeping the example as well as the work in
mind that it seemed to them hardly more than play
when a good clear printed copy of the questions lay
before them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>What the nerves of the children of 1869 were made
of is a mystery, but sure it is that after graduating
from the grammar school on Tuesday, going through
part of the high school examinations on Wednesday,
Ella, and probably many others, went to a party
Wednesday evening, and on Thursday finished the
examinations—geography, grammar, spelling, history,
and music. Thursday afternoon there was a
visitor for Ella to take shopping. The visitor went
home at night, and now there was time to think. Ella
began to be a little alarmed. She thought over one of
her answers after another, and wondered whether she
had by mistake slipped in a wrong word or figure.
“I must be head of the city,” she said to herself. “I
want it! I want it! Oh, I want it! I do so wish the
principal would come and tell me.”</p>

<p>The doorbell rang; the principal had come.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad!” Ella cried. “Do please tell me
where I stand!”</p>

<p>“You know it takes some time to look over all
those papers,” said the principal kindly, “but I will
see that you know the results just as soon as possible.
I came about the map. Have you forgotten about
the map for which a prize was to be given?”</p>

<p>She had not forgotten, but prizes for maps seemed
a very small matter to her now, and it really required
a little effort to thank the principal as warmly as she
thought he would expect. After he had gone, she
opened the package rather indifferently. It contained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
a handsome copy of Æsop’s Fables. With its corners
put into slits in the flyleaf was a card with her name
and the date. She laid the book down, and wandered
restlessly about the room. “Did you notice how
queerly he looked at me?” she said to her mother.
“He knows that some one else is ahead of me, and
that is why he wouldn’t come in. He was very good
to bring the book, but I don’t care one bit for it or
for anything in it.” She took up the book indifferently
and began to turn the leaves over; and behold, with
the corners put into slits in a second flyleaf was another
card, and on it was written, “Ella, 94 per cent
average. Highest in the city.”</p>

<p>One day Ella heard the bell of the grammar school
ringing faintly across the old cemetery, and she went
down the path between the graves of the Revolutionary
heroes to visit the school. The principal and
the assistant gave her a warm welcome and a seat on
the platform just as if she was a committee man.
The pupils looked at her enviously, just as she used
to look at the high school girls when they came back
to visit. The big waste-basket stood near her. On
top of the scraps of paper was a half-sheet, and on it
was written a line or two in the “Tories’ Alphabet.”
She wondered which of these children were “best
friends” and had been admitted to the secret. New
maps were on the board, not hers nor those of any of
her class. A girl whom she had not especially liked
was sitting in her old seat. A class from the Second
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>Room had been promoted, and how young they did
look! They were just babies!</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">ON IT WAS WRITTEN, “ELLA, 94 PER CENT AVERAGE.
HIGHEST IN THE CITY”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Aren’t those children from the Second Room a
great deal younger than we were when we came in?”
she asked.</p>

<p>The assistant smiled. She had heard that question
before.</p>

<p>“Just the same average age,” she replied; “but you
know that you have grown up. You are not a little
girl any longer; you are a young lady of the high
school.”</p>

<p>There was a lump in Ella’s throat. Something had
gone out of her life. She was not “in it” any more—and
“it” was her vanished childhood.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
